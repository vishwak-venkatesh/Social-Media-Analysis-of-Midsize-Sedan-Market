ahightower,Jan-14,I count that in the Accord's favor...
[Deleted User],Jan-14,"Yes, but the car is in the way when looking to the right. Looking left I/you/we have no blind spot."
[Deleted User],Jan-14,"It's winter, and the dealer topped off my windshield washer fluid using fluid provided by Kia. I have never used my own fluid, since I take the car in for oil changes and inspection every three months.
I bet the Mercedes S class has heated washer nozzles, but hey...at least I don't have a clown face dash to look at.
LOL."
akirby,Jan-14,Of course you have a blind spot on the left side. There are blind spots on both sides of the vehicle. If you adjust your mirrors properly you can eliminate the blind spot. And when you turn your head and look you can see if there is a car in the blind spot on either side - which I still do even with BLIS and with having my mirrors adjusted properly. These aids are just extra insurance - not a substitute.
[Deleted User],Jan-14,"**
Are you sure you don't want to talk about blind spots more?
The Accord Sport is the best car value on the market, period. It is not just me that thinks that. Car and Drivers' ten best issue did as well. You may want to contemplate the Mazda 6 Touring. as well, which also made the 10 best list. The 6 is a VERY competitive car, with competitive specs, and (marginally) better handling than either the Accord and the Passat. Really the Accord is the bargain here though. I would love to have a blue one with the M/T if you are listening Honda!!
The Passat still looks like a bread box, but I have to admit that the sport model looks nice and more like the 3.6 SEL. The 1.8 turbo will leave you wanting in the power department however. Also, it offers only 5 manual cogs vs the 6-speeds in the Asian cars. The Passat is an older (comparatively) design than either of the others. 170 hp is just not enough for a car this size. Driving in this area, I would have to keep the revs up too much, which kills MPG.
For example, I really like the smooth power delivery in my 2.4 liter (Optima EX) and with the 6 speed auto, and 200 hp is just right for a 3200 lb car."
ivan_99,Jan-14,"I think the Passat Sport ""looks"" the best. Those 19"" wheels certainly look expensive and probably contribute to the higher price. I think the blacked out roof and mirrors give it a very nice look overall.
I'm probably the only one, but I don't care for the Accord design. It just looks like an old design to me. The Mazda 6 and Fusion are tops in design.
I do however have issues with a ""Sport"" badge that does not include any sport upgrades. Lower springs...stiffer, a slight boost in the turbo would go a long way in legitimizing the badging. An APR chip would probably fix the engine side of the ""sport""...if one were so inclined..."
garythesnail,Jan-14,"""Mazda6: Despite getting redesigned for the 2014 model year, a re-engineered Mazda6 is scheduled to arrive in late 2014 or early 2015 with a new interior and updated front fascia.
Since the debut this year, the redesigned Mazda6's interior has been criticized by some as bland. Sources say the new interior will include new gauges, instrument clusters, materials, center stack design and seating surfaces, as well as a version of the connectivity and infotainment system in the upcoming Mazda3. The new interior's overall aesthetic will be similar to that of the 2014 Mazda3, but more refined to help the mid-sized sedan keep its place atop the hierarchy of Mazda's cars.""
Let's hope they dump that stupid leatherette (vinyl) seating material on the Touring model."
m6user,Jan-14,"@garythesnail
Usually when adding quotes one references the source. Where did you read read this? I was at my Mazda dealer yesterday and they said pretty much nothing was changing on the 6 for the 2015 model year. I was just in for service and shooting the bull with the service manager so it wasn't some salesman trying to sell the 2014 model. But it wouldn't be the first time a dealer was just not up to speed on the latest and greatest. But if you're source is right and it doesn't arrive until early 2015, it would probably be a 2016 model. Tks."
stickguy,Jan-14,"just read the autoblog preview on the passat sport, and it repeatedly said it came with a 6 speed manual.
also, anyone know if that roof opens, or is it just some sort of fixed smoked glass?
and maybe it is just me, but I can't stand those 19"" wheels. Look very mis-proportioned to me. Like bad aftermarket ""dubs"".
17"" wheels would be more than big enough to me."
wayne21,Jan-14,I find the BLIS / Lanewatch topics quite interesting. It makes me wonder how people managed to get from point A to point B all these years without them. I seem to have done so for 40 years of accident-free driving. It makes me wonder if the idea behind driverless cars is because the technology will be there to do it or if it is because people are too lazy to drive their own cars or if it will be because people are too dumb to drive.
[Deleted User],Jan-14,"I think the rims look good...they match the car pretty well. I don't like the 170 hp in such a big car. If I am going German, I want the 2.0T in the Golf GTI. $25 or $27,500 with the sport seats and in dash GPS."

[Deleted User],Jan-14,"I find that at 3/4 throttle gives me the most satisfying acceleration. The torque just kind of slings it through the gears smoothly and it feels like it has a ton more power in reserve.... they really nailed it on the smooth powertrain. I think they did a on the Optima, and it sure has nice duds to wrap it all up in. The chassis is certainly adequate, but it lacks a true sporty feeling.
With a little more suspension experience, Honda and Toyota should be very worried."
ivan_99,Jan-14,"Yeah...autoblog said 6 spd manual. I think the other mags say 5spd, and the current Passat manual is 5spd so it's probably a 5spd.

criteria seemed to be 1) cheap, and 2) anything else. In terms of a good lease price, nothing down. Foreign or domestic. Currently driving a well-worn Corolla (so yeah, bar set real low).
Gave them Camry and Sonata as probably the 2 best basic options with a low lease price now. With the Fusion a contender. And the mazda 6 as the one I liked, but likely to cost more!"

[Deleted User],Jan-14,"I have noticed that the standard Fusion 17"" wheels look a whole lot like the Optima LX 16"" alloys. So, I was curious and went to the Fusion site and built my own Fusion SE, just to familiarize myself a little better with the options, like which model gets which rims, etc.
I added the 2.0 ecoboost to the base SE...and then automatically you get a nice set of 5 star 18"" rims, and a decent price of $26,500. Not bad for the 240 hp model, 6 speed auto, nice black cloth seats, and the regular stereo system with all the bluetooth, USB, and aux input features included.

We parked in the exact same parking spot (I was driving) and I couldn't even see a tree. In fact, I'd bet there wasn't a tree within 100 feet of the parking place.

[Deleted User],Jan-14,"VW launched both the Jetta and Passat during a soft market on both continents, offering good, basic cars, while others designed sexy-looking sedans with that looked more like coupes, and were packed with features and smartly designed interiors with near luxury materials. I commend VW for sticking with what they do best and offering great driving, high quality, affordable sedans...but the sales figures show which formula Americans preferred, by and large, and with the longer warranties offered by the competition, VW just couldn't keep many folks in the showroom.
Remember the Renault Alliance America? I Still do. In fact, I will never forget it. I think it had 80 hp.
Buffalo NY, 1983.
On a way to a very big wedding, 5 of us thick framed polish Americans were packed in an airport-rented Renault Alliance. We were going up a very steep hill on Military road, about 1/4 mile south of the Armory. What happened next was so surreal we almost couldn't believe it ourselves. A very very large tank broke loose from its tie-downs while being loaded on a trailer, and began rolling down the hill towards us. My father was not good with a stick, and by the time he got it together we were out of time. Panicked, he threw it in reverse, and backed us into a side road about 10 seconds before we were flattened, with about 20 reservists tearing after it as it continued rolling down the aptly named road.

benjaminh,Jan-14,".

The Accord Sport is a good deal, but I think that the Accord EX is maybe just as good.
Here's a comparison:
Accord Sport 6 MT
$23,715 msrp
Accord EX 6 MT
$24,880
This is a difference of $1165. With the EX you gain: a moonroof, smart entry, push button start, heated mirrors, lockable glove box, 6 speaker stereo, Honda Lanewatch side camera.
But, and this will be a big deal to cksi, you loose the huge wheels and tires of the Sport, and you also lose the dual exhaust.
From my point of view, however, although the wheels and dual exhaust do look great, that are not really necessary. And if you keep the car for a long time, it'll be very pricey to get replacement tires since iirc, those 235/45R1894V tires cost something like $300 each at retail. And because those wheels are so big, the turning circle on the Sport, at 39.6, is larger than for the rest of the Accords, which is a more nimble 38.1.
I'm tempted by the Sport, but the EX might be more my cup of tea. And really, the LX is a great deal at $21,955. It has all the essentially goodness of the Accord for $1760 less than the Sport and $2925 less than the EX.
But since I still mostly love my 2008 Accord EXL navi 5 mt, I'm planning on sticking with it for another 2-4 years before I get my next Accord...."
stickguy,Jan-14,"I agree that the sport looks sharp, but like you, I want the features on the EX more. And I don't like the real low profile tires either, due to cost, and the fact that the roads around here are 1 giant pothole, and I want as much sidewall as I can get!"
brian125,Jan-14,"ben
Dont wait to long the next gen Accord in 4 years will be able to fly. your dual exhaust will be replaced with a propella"
dudleyr,Jan-14,"Couple things left out that the EX Accord has but the Sport does not.
Turn signals in the mirrors.
Rear seat heat and A/C vents in the center console
Additional lighting - backlighting for more of the switches.
Tighter turning radius - another disadvantage of the larger tires."
benjaminh,Jan-14,"I'd forgotten about the rear ac vents. Those are really useful for the folks in back. We have them in our 2013 Accord EXL navi, and I like them a lot."
benjaminh,Jan-14,"Yeah, part of me is wondering if I can wait for the 2018 Accord, which might well have a ""turbo propella"" lol--but I don't think I want to wait that long. But maybe.
When I got my 2008 with the navi, it was a little bit of a gamble, because I didn't know if the voice recognition would work. But it mostly does work for me. I think I must have an unusually clear voice or something, since I know for some people it just doesn't work enough to be useful.
So, on the one hand, I like a manual transmission for the sporty driving and fast acceleration. On the other hand, I love comfort and gadgets and am kind of addicted to to top of the line experience in my 2008 exl navi with the manual. I special ordered it too, and so there are probably only a dozen or so cars exactly like it in the whole country. I got nice replacement tires, Michel Pilots, just a year ago, and so those probably have another 4 years of life in them. I'm at 67,000 miles and so about 30,000 miles away from the major 100k service. I'm thinking that before the tires go again, and before the tune up is needed, I'll trade her in, but it'll be tough to let her go. I'm really fond of the ""White Whale,"" as we call her. My wife's car, the 2013 Accord exl navi in Basque Red Pearl we call ""Tabasco."" I do like my wife cvt for the mpg. And the rest of the car is a step beyond mine in almost every way."
dudleyr,Jan-14,What major tuneup? The only tuneup I did on my 2007 was replace the irridium plugs at 130k (and they still looked almost new). 170k miles right now and the only non maintenance item was an o2 sensor at 120k miles. Front brakes are still original as is the clutch. If you really like the top end stick you may need to keep it a while as they are getting rare.
ahightower,Jan-14,"One would expect the EX to be better equipped for more money. One has to draw the line somewhere. The LX really does have everything necessary, and more. Power everything, bluetooth, backup camera. Those are the essentials, so it seems. A solid package for a very good price. But what sold me on the Sport were its upgrades vs the LX, for not a whole lot of money ($1720):
-dual exhaust (good for 4 whole hp, woot)
-18-inch wheels (good design, nice stance)
-leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob (who wants to grab a plastic steering wheel every day? EX does not have this.)
-upgraded cloth upholstery (vs LX and EX)
-10-way power adjustment (incl lumbar - HUGE for me, EX does not have this either, you have to go EX-L)
-decklid spoiler (purely cosmetic, but what can I say, I haven't given up on trying to look cool yet...)
-fog lights (not that I really need them, just that I absolutely despise blanks where fog lights are supposed to go, advertising that I got the ""cheap"" one)
-sport suspension (I've read this somewhere, but not seeing it specifically called out on the Honda website)
At any rate, it's not just cosmetics. As for the larger wheels, I find the ride perfectly comfortable and quiet. I didn't compare to an LX test drive, but it's like a dang Lexus compared to my old Mazda3. I know replacement tires will be more expensive, but what can I say, they just look great. Vanity got me again. Turning radius has not been a problem, as I don't live in a tiny parking garage or an autocross course.
As for the EX's perceived benefits:
-moonroof - tall guy, hot climate, why give up headroom and let in more sun?
-stereo upgrade - would be nice, but I'm a talk radio/podcast nerd. Music sound quality from the
base stereo is acceptable from digital sources (FM sucks)
-Push-button start/smart entry. Nifty. Have had it on many rental cars, and won't deny its convenience.
-Lane watch... see prior discussion. I guess it's cool, but I haven't missed its absence.
Frankly, I'd have the Sport over the EX even if they were the exact same price.
Moral of the story:
Honda is a bit aggravating with their few trim levels. There are a couple things I wish I could have selected a la carte. But then you end up nickel and dimed to death as with Toyota and, to a lesser extent, Ford. So, you choose the trim that suits your needs, preferences, budget, and to each his own. I like to think of mine as the ""driver's Accord"".
And ya know, the EX-L is not such a stretch, and with that you get heated leather, LEDs, touchscreen, memory seats, etc... Ooh, ooh, maybe the new Hybrid!... Again, we must all draw the line somewhere. Even the guy with the Touring had to decide he wasn't going to get an Acura..."
ahightower,Jan-14,EX-L Navi manual - you really do have something of a unicorn there!
ahightower,Jan-14,Which switches exactly? I did not know this.
benjaminh,Jan-14,"Wow. So those iridium spark plugs can often go beyond 100k. Is iridium more durable than platinum for this application?
I don't do my own work, and so I'm not sure what the dealer would charge for a 100k service, but maybe 1k? If I go that route I should maybe shop around and/or not get everything done that they are calling for.
I do like my 2008, but my wife's 2013 is giving me some car envy. Her Accord is quieter and more luxurious, and has a lot of features mine doesn't have. I do notice that the steering of my 08, with the hydraulic, feels a little heavier and more direct, in a good way. But, frankly, the acceleration of my 190hp vtec isn't quite as fast as I would like. The new Accord is a little lighter and, more importantly, the direct injected earth dreams engine has more torque. Some 0-60 tests of the new manual Accords have shown sub 7 second times, which is probably 2 seconds faster than I can do in my 08. I know I'll never match a magazine's time, but even 7.5 would be nice for merging on the freeway with the uphill ramp that I take every day after work.
The EX does have a lot of stuff, and is about 5k less than the EXL navi iirc. I don't actually need leather seats, and slightly prefer cloth. I actually worry that the leather seats of my 08 will crack at some point. I'd better condition em again soon. And with a smart phone, maybe the navi is less needed these days. On the other hand, the CVT my wife has will probably beat the mpg of the 6 mt, and so maybe I should just save up for that. Decisions, decisions. My car still has plenty of life in it, and so it's just a fun time waster to consider what I might do some day."

I agree what you said about the Accord and its looks. For me the EXL V-6 was the clear choice and the best bang for my buck. I enjoy that extra power from the V-6, the leather , lights and all the little extra's that make this accord special. My neighbor has the The 4cyl with smaller tires and one exhaust, basic lights. Its like night and day in the looks dept. When you see the V-6 exl on the road it is a sharp vehicle.
Upgrading from the LX, to the...... Sport model or the EX, is a must in the looks dept. Dont get caught looking like granny in this new accord.....LOL"
ahightower,Jan-14,"Best MT I've ever driven. Smooth shifter, clutch is easy but not too light. I agree it took some getting used to, but I only stalled twice in the first few hundred miles and never since. I think I was taking full advantage of all the new leg room vs my last car and getting using to the driving position. And the gearing is different than what I was used to (pretty short 1st, and 4-5 is rather close so I often just wind out 4th and skip to 6th). But after a short time it feels very natural. Creeping in traffic is no problem. All the praise for Honda manual transmissions in the enthusiast mags is true. I almost bought a Civic or Fit back in '08 because their MT was so nice, but the deal I got on the Mazda3 was too good to pass up. And that Mazda was also a good transmission, really a good car overall. Traded it in with 90K and no issues, just wanted to upgrade really. But the Honda MT is better. The hill-holding feature is also very nice. Not necessary, because of course I am an expert driver, but very convenient when there is a texter right on your bumper..."

akirby,Jan-14,You should never leave the spark plugs in place for more than 100k (80k on aluminum heads). Even if you don't need to replace them you should remove and replace them so they don't get welded to the head and break off.

[Deleted User],Jan-14,"Wow, so much to comment on. I agree with ahightower on the sun/moon roof. I need the headroom. As a bonus my car is 150 lbs lighter, and there is no chance of potential leaks and squeaks over time.
I still like the Accord Sport, despite what the EX has to offer. The wheels and exhaust plus fog lights is the look that I like, but you do get only 4 speakers in the stereo. However, it is listed as having 160 watts, which is good. Also, the 10 way drivers seat (listed here @Edmunds as an 8 way) and the leather steering wheel and shift knob is also important to me as I will be touching them very frequently.
There was a time when a sports car, or sport package, was actually a more bare-bones car that was a hoot to drive on weekends and track days. Now ""sport"" is affixed to almost every car in some way. Things like ""sport shift mode"" on an automatic is simply the manual operation of the same automatic trans gears that are in the rest of the lineup. My moms 83' Plymouth Reliant Wagon had ""sport shift"" then (D, 2,1).
I like the Accord Sports black cloth seats too. Very grippy and great looking in black.
The rear vents, push button start, turn signals in the mirrors, all can be added on later. My choice is still absolutely the Accord Sport. The white one that I see all the time in my neighborhood always makes me look back at it and stare, and I can only imagine that owning one like it would produce the same effect in spades."
akirby,Jan-14,Ok - 100K miles or 7 years. You're lucky that's not an aluminum head or you'd probably be replacing the entire head just to get the plugs out!
dudleyr,Jan-14,EX does have 10 way power with lumbar.
[Deleted User],Jan-14,"I just looked at both the 2013 Sport M/T and the 2013 EX M/T. Both have 8 way adjustable power seats. Only the EX is listed with lumbar support. My source was right here in Edmund's.
On the 2014 specs it lists both cars as having lumbar support. I think the 2013 specs may be a listing error with Edmund's. Does anyone have a 2013 Sport with power lumbar? How bout an EX?
Now, I just went over to Honda's site, and compared both cars with both transmissions, and Honda says that all 4 have 10 way power seats with power lumbar. Honda also listed all 4 variants as having manual transmissions, so even Honda is confused about what car comes with what. I guess you get a bonus M/T in case your CVT explodes, which is what we all have feared in the first place.

benjaminh,Jan-14,"Only a few of the players are really satisfied with their place in the midsize market. Even Toyota, according to an article in Auto News today, wants its forever boring and mediocre Camry to be more interesting. Nissan is said to be let down with the performance in the market of the Altima, which they once thought might go to #1 or 2, but which now seems stuck between 3rd and 4th place, and has had some quality issues. The Sonata, after riding high in 2011 and 2012, apparently saw its sales to rental fleets soar 40% last year, and discounts are heavy. Maybe this is one reason why the former head of Hyundai USA, John Krafchek, isn't there anymore? Don't know. VW has been bitterly let down by the weak sales of the Passat, which meant laying off 500 workers at its new factory in TN, and even laying off the head of VW of America.
I think the only players who feel happy with their position in the midsize market right now are: Honda, which is staying at a strong #2 (and even outsold the Camry last month) without huge discounts; Ford, which saw sales of the Fusion jump 22% last year and has started production in the US; and Mazda, which is getting rave reviews for its Mazda6 and sold a whopping 200% more in December than a year ago (which was still only 4,365 cars).
At this point the players can make more of these cars than people in the US can buy, which is leading to intense competition over features, price, and financing. And so, it's a buyer's market.
For reference, here are the sales numbers again from last month:
Accord 32,321
Camry 29,964
Altima 24,816
Fusion 24,408
Malibu 15,493
Sonata 14,479
Optima 9,474
Passat 9,254
200 5,652
Avenger 4,950
Mazda6 4,365
My predictions for 2014: Fusion will pass Altima and become the #3 selling midsize car. Accord will get close to the Camry but won't quite pass it, since Honda won't play the ""0%+ 2000 rebate"" game. The Mazda6, I think, might pass the Dodge Avenger, but that's not saying much.
Maybe Honda is the only one selling close to capacity at this point. I think they can make about 33,000 Accords a month for the US market, and that's almost what they sold. Iirc, Toyota can make up to 40,000 Camrys a month, and so they are already way under what they can do. I believe Ford and Nissan have about the same capacity as Honda, and so they are selling about 8000 fewer midsize cars a month than they are able to make...."

Toyota readies remix of Camry with 'waku-doki'
Alan Ohnsman
January 17, 2014 - 10:38 am ET
DETROIT (Bloomberg) -- Toyota Motor Corp. has a challenge: How to heed President Akio Toyoda's insistence on heart-racing design for the next Camry and Prius models without jeopardizing their mass-market appeal.
Getting it wrong risks knocking Camry from its perch as the best-selling U.S. car, a title held for 12 consecutive years, and seeing Prius, which sells more than 200,000 units annually in the U.S., eclipsed by newer hybrid vehicles. While next-generation versions of both cars are in the works, Toyota executives haven't provided many details.
The aim for the next Camry is a ""more emotional, more impactful design,"" Kevin Hunter, head of Toyota's U.S. design studio, said in an interview at the Detroit auto show this week. ""Camry's taken some hits on styling, but it's still selling well. But we need to create better design for Camry in the future.""
Toyoda, grandson of the company's founder, is pushing an overhaul of vehicles with an emphasis on ""waku-doki"" design, shorthand for the Japanese phrase for heart-racing qualities. That would break from the current styling of the Camry and Prius, which together accounted for about a third of the company's U.S. sales volume last year....

""Mazda6: Despite getting redesigned for the 2014 model year, a re-engineered Mazda6 is scheduled to arrive in late 2014 or early 2015 with a new interior and updated front fascia.
Since the debut this year, the redesigned Mazda6's interior has been criticized by some as bland. Sources say the new interior will include new gauges, instrument clusters, materials, center stack design and seating surfaces, as well as a version of the connectivity and infotainment system in the upcoming Mazda3. The new interior's overall aesthetic will be similar to that of the 2014 Mazda3, but more refined to help the mid-sized sedan keep its place atop the hierarchy of Mazda's cars.
A 2.2-liter turbodiesel will be added to the powertrain lineup this year. Sources say that a hybrid powertrain is under study.""

[Deleted User],Jan-14,"Cool!And you have Predictions too!
I think that everything you said is dead on. It is a buyers market, unless you want the Accord. For quite a long time I have felt what most of us know, that the Accord is the most desirable mid-size on the market, so folks are not going to have salespeople begging at their feet at the local Honda store.
Also, The day of the Camry and it's supernatural build quality have passed. It is just another mid size sedan, and only the SE V 6 stands out as one I would gladly have in my driveway. Unfortunately, I would have the Honda and it's buttery smooth 3.5 instead, and so would many others.
My Optima has slipped below 10,000 units a month. There are a few new adverts for the Optima, with one about a father rushing home in his SX-L Optima to deliver a goldfish home before his young daughter realizes hers has passed; and replaced with an impostor. I think the restyle looks great in the front, but the ""diffuser"" in the back is a bit much, and does not at all do anything for under-car airflow like it does on real racing cars. A bit much is being kind. Garish is more like it."
[Deleted User],Jan-14,I have not heard anything about a refresh either. I can't understand why folks are not at Mazda dealers in droves for these cars. The Mazda 3 is almost even better than the 6. It's Audi-like interior and logical control layout is rated as superb. I can't wait to see more of them on the road..all of them.
brian125,Jan-14,The mazda 3 is a nice car but much to small to be a contender with adults.
benjaminh,Jan-14,"Actually, even the Accord can be had for big discounts. I got almost $2700 off msrp on my 2013 EXL Navi, and that's when the model was just a few months old. And some people have done better than that. And Honda is even offering 0.9% on the Accord for 5 years. So even on the Accord you can get a great value and a very good deal.
But you won't get 0% and 4000+ off list like with some Camry models. As everyone says, the Accord is just a better car than the Camry in pretty much every way, and so they don't have to give them away. At least not yet. But even Honda is feeling the competitive heat. I actually credit the Sonata and the Optima with making Honda step up its game and add lots of stuff as standard (including a direct injected engine) for a very good price.
With Honda looking for 30,000 new Accord customers every month, even they are blowing them out the doors to some extent...."
brian125,Jan-14,A camry per unit cost is over 1k per vehicle less than a Accord. That with Toyota's fleet sales puts them over the top.
m6user,Jan-14,"Mazda, from everything I've read in the news, seems to be pleased as punch with it's sales of the Mazda6 and sell about as many as they can build and ship over from Japan. I'd like to know from where somebody ""heard"" differently. They couldn't meet demand the first few months but are now catching up. The refresh doesn't appear to be any kind of drastic redesign but just the infotainment system is going to be changed to basically what the Mazda3 has. That system was not ready when the redesigned 6 went on sale early last year. Now, whether the 2015 Mazda6 will have it this year or the 2016 model which won't arrive until next year, 2015 I don't know. According to that autonews article apparently they don't know either and are guessing as to when the upgrade will be. Everyone is expecting the upgrade to the infotainment system after seeing the new one in the Mazda3 and it is pretty nice and does make the one in the Mazda6 seem ""old"" in comparison.
There is nothing in that article that insinuates that Mazda is disappointed with the Mazda6 sales."
brian125,Jan-14,"The toyota matrix was a nice little vehicle. I think it was discontinued. The mazda 3 is def. a better car.
Is the mazda 3 bigger than the hyundai veloster."
[Deleted User],Jan-14,"Right, and the Camry just didn't live up to it's customer expectations. The interior is cheap looking, with C/D saying it's materials were ""barely acceptable"" and ""is fake aluminum supposed to squishy and able to be scratched off with a fingernail? As a matter of fact, if Mr.Toyoda loses the ""best selling car in America"" moniker, I fully believe that the board of directors will expect him to commit Hari-Kari at sunrise the following morning."
akirby,Jan-14,"If the new Camry is anything like the prototype I saw a few months ago, the competition has nothing whatsoever to worry about. It's an improvement over the current one, but not by much."
benjaminh,Jan-14,"Didn't the Camry get a full redesign in 2012? If so, I think this would just be a mild refresh, since it's probably on a c. 5 year cycle for a full redesign? I bet, however, that they are beefing up the steel structure so that it can pass the IIHS small offset test."
wayne21,Jan-14,"I could not agree more on the mazda 6 interior. I think it has the sharpest exterior of the class, but once you open the door the party is over! It just looks dull and cheap! In fact, as much as I hate to admit this, I think it's worse than the camry's interior. I also think they are way overpriced. $30k for a 4 cyl? with a loser interior? I think they are more expensive than most of their equivalent counterparts."
ahightower,Jan-14,"They certainly begged me plenty, on the last weekend of the second quarter
But the car sells itself. I bought it despite the irritating salesman, not because of. Factory rebates are rare but dealers will sell at invoice. They know we know how to look things up online... Then they quickly tack it back on with ""dealer installed accessories"". It was not an easy negotiation from there, but deals can be had and financing is at 0.9%."
suydam,Jan-14,"I think their small dealer network is part of the problem and that probably keeps prices higher than they should be too. I had an '04 Mazda6 wagon awhile back. Terrific car. Wish they would make a wagon again. Very practical for dogs. It was a gas hog though, not like their current lineup. And back then there were at least 3 dealerships in the city closest to me. Now there's only 1."
wayne21,Jan-14,"I believe wagons are still made, but they call them crossovers. When I was shopping for a station wagon I bought a venza. To me it is a camry wagon. Cheapest, hardest plastic Toyota could find for an interior, but it had the wagon characteristics I was looking for."
[Deleted User],Jan-14,"I think Mazda is taking things step by step. First, they had to offer a solid foundation. A product that is great at the core. They can then introduce a more powerful engine (like a 2.0T) after generating some income and hopefully selling some top-end GT models that have a healthier profit margin than say the entry-level Sport model.
I have driven a Mazda 6 Touring. The interior is VERY well screwed together, and is just as nice in most ways as my Optima EX (a direct equivalent trim wise). My gripe with it was the small LED readouts and the never ending sea of black plastic, but it is at least good quality plastic. It handles like a dream though, and is absolutely stunning in red.
Lastly, $31,000 for a sedan with only 185 hp is not going to cut it for me either. Mazda better get some zoom under the hood ASAP... IMHO."
[Deleted User],Jan-14,"Here is the black on black Mazda 6 interior like the one I drove. It looks great....just too much black for some people. I can't tell if the seats are leather or leatherette, but they look like perforated leather. I would have no problem with this being my office."
[Deleted User],Jan-14,"I/we also had a 2004 Mazda 6 wagon. It was a black Sportwagon V6 w/ 240 hp. It was actually my wife's car. We had trouble keeping the A?C working, it liked to hydroplane a bit too much, too, and the transmission was kaput at 67 k. It drive great though, and back then 240 hp was really powerful for a mid size wagon."
ab348,Jan-14,"I don't think there is anything particularly wrong with it from that picture, though the sea of black would not appeal to me as I hate black interiors. I understand they have a parchment version that still has a lot (perhaps too much) black in it that I might like better. With interiors I find you need to experience them in person to get a sense of the materials quality. I wonder if the criticism comes from it being a bit too conservative in design and not swoopy inside like the Fusion and others? I know that is de rigeur these days but I am not a fan of that style."
suydam,Jan-14,Ours is still on the road. We had no problems with it. Fuel economy not great. Only sold it because of vehicle changes with one child going abroad for a year. Every time I see the person who bought it she tells me how much she loves it. It would be good if Mazda had one kind of vehicle you couldn't get anywhere else. Like the good luck Kia has had with the Soul or Nissan with the Leaf or Honda's Fit.

Accord and 6 interiors are ok for base models, but really fall short when compared to the higher end of their competition.
So what would you consider higher end. The 2014 EXL v-6 is selling at 26 to 27 k with tax excluded. I cant think of any vehicles that have this much to offer for that price, resale, and build quality.."
explorerx4,Jan-14,"I have a Titanium model Fusion. My boss has an Accord EXL. Interiors do not compare.
Mid size cars don't need a V6 anymore. The 2.0 turbo is a good balance of power, more than I need, and fuel economy."
brian125,Jan-14,"Explorer,
Both cars are priced about the same. My problem with the fusion is i just cant get past that ugly front grille look. Toyota did a similar look on the new Avalon but the grille isn't as large. I remember the older fusions they had very wide window pillars that block your turning view. I rented a 2012 fusion se and hated it .. Did they make the window pillars smaller with the new redesign??.. Is it bigger inside.. What kind of mpg are you getting with the 2.0.
My V-6 accord gets very good gas mileage if you drive sensible.. my gas mileage was between 23 to 26 mpg. in nyc area when i drove it slow.. My 2013 Accord which is now my daughters car was the best Accord i owned compared to my other 3 Accords . My only problem with this Accord is i hate the parking brake in the center console. At almost 6' 2 there are not many Cars that i find comfortable. I love my SUV's"
benjaminh,Jan-14,"suydam: The Mazda5 is still made, and you can even get it with a 6-speed manual. But it hasn't yet been given the Skyactiv treatment, and so mpg is, as you say, mediocre. I owned a 2010 Mazda5 for a couple of years, and I liked it in terms of the handling, the room, and the performance of the engine and transmission. But the interior felt cheap to me, and it had poor rear visibility."
brian125,Jan-14,It would be nice to take the five best models in this class and make your own vehicle from each of the 5 different companies. Take the best each have to offer making one bad [non-permissible content removed] vehicle..
benjaminh,Jan-14,"The Fusion is a very nice car with great looks, inside and out, as well as very strong performance.
But it seems like a draw at best for the Fusion in the engine dept. Both the V-6 Accord and 2.0 Fusion are rated by the epa at 26 combined for mpg, but according to edmunds.com the V-6 Accord will go from 0-60 in 6.1 seconds, while their test of the Fusion to 0-60 was 6.9. That's a significant difference.

Car and Driver got a V-6 Accord to go even faster than that, and in fact it tied a BMW 328i:
With less weight to haul around—3552 pounds versus 3607 for the last V-6 sedan we tested—our Touring example sprinted to 60 mph in 5.6 seconds and tripped the quarter-mile lights in 14.1 seconds at 101 mph. Those figures put it solidly ahead of all its competitors and into sports-sedan territory; the Accord ties our long-term, six-speed-manual BMW 328i to 60 and trumps that car in the quarter by 0.2 second and 1 mph.

Motor Trend tested the Sport Accord 2.4 6MT at just 6.8 going zero to 60. In other words, in manual form it can give a 2.0 turbo Fusion a run for its money:

benjaminh,Jan-14,"The new 2015 Ford F-150, out in about 6 months, apparently has lost 500-700 pounds of weight because of the use of high quality aluminum alloys. Could this work for midsize cars? What are the costs and the risks? How much weight, do you think, could be lost in this way? And what would the performance boost of this be for mpg and performance for the next generations of midsize cars due in about 4 years.
Total guess here, but it's remotely possible that someone like Honda might follow the road that Ford is blazing here. If aluminum is strong enough for a truck, and works in terms of manufacturing, performance, and commercial acceptance, why not do it for a car? It might make the car costs $500-$1000 more, which is perhaps the biggest challenge. You'd save more than that in gas in probably 5 years, and maybe less, but....
My guess is you could potentially shed 300 pounds of weight in this way, which might not sound big but is in fact almost 10% of the weight of the car. With 10% less weight you could have an engine that was 10% smaller and have the same acceleration and significantly better mpg.
The next generation of Accord, for instance, due in just a little more than 3.5 years, needs to get mpg as high as the current Civic, which gets 30 in the city and 39 on the highway. And yet the next Accord still needs to have about the same interior room as the current Accord. It needs to shrink on the outside, and get lighter, without shrinking much on the inside.
I do think the V-6 is probably doomed in the long run for the Accord. Even though I feel lukewarm at best about turbos, I think Honda will probably go with a c. 2.0 turbo as the next high performance Accord. This would allow them to shrink the engine compartment by a few inches without shrinking the passenger compartment. The standard engine could potentially be a 2.2 normally aspirated ice, which, with the next generation earth dreams cvt might be able to get the mpg of today's civic. Or close, anyway.
You can bet the Honda engineers, as well as the engineers of every other player in the midsize market, is gaming out scenarios for how to get to 30 mpg city and 40 mpg highway without a hybrid.
VW has already tested a 1.4 turbo 4 that can deactivate 2 cylinders at highway speed and get as much as 42 mpg, and so this is possible."
explorerx4,Jan-14,"@brian125
In about 11 months and 11k miles, I've averaged just over 28 mpg. Low 23.8 and high 34.5, a couple of times. I only measure tank to tank using actual fill numbers.

""That took some guts,"" said Mark Bacchus, a Toyota r&d engineer who works at the company's Ann Arbor, Mich., technical center. ""It's an aggressive maneuver...
""At Toyota, a proposal like this would prompt the question 'What are you doing to offset cost?'"" he said. ""But we are tiptoeing in that direction. We are already doing aluminum hoods.""
An engineer for ThyssenKrupp Steel said as he examined part of the roof rail, ""We knew it was coming. I'm kind of intrigued by it. I don't know of any other way to get that much weight out."" The engineer declined to give his name.

With the use of aluminum, I think it might be possible to get a midsize car down to c. 2950 lbs. What do you folks think?"
explorerx4,Jan-14,"A 328i is a base BMW. Ok, the 320i is the new base BMW.

About the F150, Ford started mass producing aluminum vehicles in 1989.

backy,Jan-14,"There's something a lot cheaper and easier than using lots of aluminum in mid-sized cars: make 'em a little smaller. ""Compacts"" like the Jetta, Corolla, and Sentra already have interiors that would have been considered roomy in the mid-sized class just a few years ago. So, shave about a foot off the mid-sized cars of today, to around 180 inches or so, and that itself will save a few hundred pounds. Then use lighter powertrains, e.g. 1.4 turbos with aluminum blocks, and save more weight.
At the same time, automakers can make ""compacts""... well, COMPACT again.
If folks need more room than a trimmed-down mid-size, or they just like more metal around them, they can go for the likes of the Avalon, Azera, Impala, Taurus etc."
benjaminh,Jan-14,"backy: You're right that midsize cars need to downsize, but what you're suggesting is a bit radical. The Accord hasn't been c. 180 inches long since the third generation, introduced way back in 1986....
Length of the Accord sedan: 1986=179 inches, 1990=185, 1994=184, 1998=189, 2004=189.5, 2008=195, 2013=191
As you know, back in the 80s and 90s, Honda and others often had basically a two car lineup: Civic, Corolla, etc for the small car and Accord, Camry, etc for the midsize car. Now Honda and most others have three cars, and so we have Fit, Civic, and Accord.
And so the Accord can and will get a little bit smaller, and so will the Civic, but not by a lot. These days if you want a car about the size of a 1986 Accord you should buy a Civic instead.
But the next generation Accord, due for model year 2018, will probably shrink a little, but just down to the size that the Accord was from 1998-2007, to about 189 inches in length, or maybe even an inch less than that. But they need to do it without sacrificing much in the way of interior room or trunk space. When people buy a midsize car today they are expecting a car that can carry 4-5 people and lots of luggage in comfort. Going down to a length of 180 for the Accord would be suicide in terms of sales."
benjaminh,Jan-14,"As we know, high gas prices mean that most people think about mpg when shopping for a new car. But the corporate average economy rules also set mpg guidelines for each class of vehicle all the way up to the year 2025. The confusing thing about cafe is that the ""54 mpg"" standard that many people have read about is pure fiction. 54 would be the epa number on your car's window sticker back in the late 70s and early 80s, but because that number was so much higher than real world mpg, the epa has twice adjusted the window sticker mpg numbers (in 1985 and 2008) to get closer to real world results.
Bottom line: The epa standard of 54 mpg for 2025 translates into a window sticker combined mpg of about 38 or even less once ""credits"" of various kinds are taken into acount. And so some people reading the headlines about 54 mpg probably think the gov't is crazy, but if you see a number like 38 it seems a lot more reasonable.
The standards for midsize cars look about like this: for 2017 the raw standard is ""38"" mpg, but that translates into a window sticker of c. 27 mpg combined. My 2013 Accord cvt already gets 30 mpg, and so already easily beats this goal, as do many other midsize cars. The goal for midsize cars for 2021 is ""45"" mpg, but that translates into a window sticker of c. 32 mpg combined.
That number right there is what most players are going to be aiming at for their next generation of midsize car, and some will try to get beyond that.
The mpg champ in the midsize market is the Nissan Altima, with a combined mpg of 31. And so Nissan is only 1 mpg away with this generation. In c. 4 years, when their next generation is introduced, we can assume they'll want to improve more than 1 mpg, and instead will target something closer to 10% or more, which would mean a window sticker of c. 33-34. Doesn't sound that impressive, but when you realize it's basically asking for an Altima to get the mpg of today's Sentra, or the Accord to get the mpg of today's Civic, it sounds much more impressive.
But it's not all the big bad gov't. The real standard for 2021 is just 32, and so what the automakers are doing already is responding to market pressure, and challenging their engineering teams, to jump the gun and beat the cafe standards by huge margins. The cafe rules allow them to ""bank"" credits for future years if they need them.
Anyway, to meet the standard of 32 mpg combined for a midsize car by 2021 it doesn't seem like aluminum is needed.
And yes, I feel like wasting time today! lol"
benjaminh,Jan-14,"More time wasting...
The epa mpg standards for midsize cars are really quite weak for the next 7 years. But for the last 4 years of the rules, from 2022 to 2025, the goals increase sharply.
In 2025, a midsize car is supposed to somehow get c. 38 mpg combined on its window sticker, which would probably be something like 32 in the city and 46 on the highway. If a midsize car of 2025 is going to get there without hybrid technology, it probably would have to use aluminum or other lightweight materials. A midsize car also might need to use what Honda has done for years with it's 6 cylinder engine--use variable cylinder management. If you had a c. 1.6 liter turbo 4 that could shut down 2 cylinders on the highway, you could probably get to 46 mpg hwy or maybe even higher in a midsize car. And so as tough as the standard is for 2025, it does seem like there might be ways to get there."
backy,Jan-14,"I don't think so. For example, the Jetta is 182 inches and has exactly the same cargo capacity as the Accord EX-L and Touring. Those Accords do have about 6 cubic feet more interior room than the Jetta, but the Accord is nearly 3 inches wider than the Jetta plus the Accord has 5 inches more wheelbase. So just shrink the length, keep the width and wheelbase (i.e. push the wheels more into the corners), and the interior volume can be maintained along with cargo volume, in a shorter and lighter car. Space efficiency in cars is a lot better than it was in the '80s. And that would be less costly in terms of price to the buyer than adding a lot of aluminum. Have you checked prices on F-150s lately? Easily go to $40k+. There's more pricing room there to add expensive aluminum than there is on mid-sized family sedans.
What you might lose in the shrinking is the ability to carry 3 adults in the back seat for long distances. I wonder how many Accord owners do that today? If I were carrying 3 adults in back for a long distance, I'd use a full sized sedan or a minivan, not a mid-sized sedan."
benjaminh,Jan-14,"Backy: You make some good points, but as you know the Accord is Honda's ""full sized sedan,"" or close to it. Honda sells something like 3-4 Accords for every Odyssey. Most people (me included) don't want to own a huge minivan, but sometimes we need our Accord (or whatever midsize car) to hold 5 people.
Maybe I'm wrong, but I just don't think that 182 inches will happen in the foreseeable future for the length of an Accord, not even in 2025. But c. 186 inches? I can see that happening by 2022, which is when the Accord that needs to meet the 2025 38 mpg standard will come out.
My guess is that the 2018 Accord will shed about 2-3 inches compared to the current model, and so would be c. 188-189 inches in length, and maybe c. 150 pounds lighter even without the use of aluminum
When I first saw the 2013 Accord up close, I could tell right away that it was smaller than my 2008. I was slightly concerned about that, because we have two kids and a dog, and so we do have a lot in our car when we go on a trip. But the magic is that the 2013 Accord actually has 1 inch more rear legroom than the 2008 Accord, plus the trunk is a full 1 cubic foot larger. We definitely enjoyed that extra room on our last trip. The new Accord has slightly less headroom, but it's not significant unless you are really, really tall."
benjaminh,Jan-14,"Ford is considering ""other aluminum-bodied vehicles"" beyond the new F-150, according to the WSJ. Could the next Fusion use aluminum? Maybe....
""....Ford began thinking about steps to substantially improve the F-series fuel efficiency in 2009 as the industry was reeling from the financial crisis and a surge in gasoline prices that pummeled sales of large trucks and sport-utility vehicles.
Engineers analyzed 100,000 combinations of materials, engines and transmissions to build an F-150 that could deliver more power and towing while substantial increasing fuel economy over the 17 mpg rating for the truck's most popular version. The team considered hybrid powertrains, diesel engines, high-strength steel and shrinking the truck.
""When we put it all together, to have the truck do what we wanted it to do, there was only one answer: aluminum,"" says Mr. Nair, who was the vice president of engineering at the time.
The truck would also have to endure the punishment dished out by the miners, contractors and farmers who are the F-150's core buyers. Advancements in high-strength alloys, some used by the military, quelled some of those fears....
Chief Operating Officer Mark Fields says he remembers when Ford reached the ""point of safe return"" and had to lock in aluminum contracts. ""I went around the room and said, 'We will all remember this day,' "" he recalls. ""We had a lot of confidence.""
....Ford won't say what it spent developing the aluminum pickup, but one insider says it was a multibillion-dollar investment, among the largest ever for a single model. Ford last month lowered its profit forecast for this year, in part because of heavy investments on product spending.
If Ford can make the aluminum F-150 without a long-term dent to profit, the move could lead a shift to aluminum from steel as the dominant material for vehicle construction. Ford already has begun development on other aluminum-bodied vehicles....

akirby,Jan-14,"I think it will show up on Lincolns first at lower volume with more profit per vehicle, but it could eventually show up in more mainstream vehicles. It took an entire Alcoa plant just to supply the F150. The interesting thing to me is how durable it is. This is not ""beer can"" aluminum to quote the negatards - the military uses this for blast shields.
They also snuck a 2015 truck into the Baja 1000 disguised as a 2014 model with aluminum and the new 2.7L ecoboost engine. It wasn't fast but it finished the 800+ mile course with no breakdowns or problems. Ford also put the 2014 aluminum panels on work trucks in the real world and it performed as good if not better than steel.
This technology is here to stay - just depends on how fast and how economically they can roll it out. I think Ford has at least a 5 year head start."
[Deleted User],Jan-14,"That's why I still love the Optima interior. The simple design with nice materials, just the right amount of sheen, A/C controls that have properly weighted knurled knobs and snick-snick accurate races that wouldn't be out of place in any Audi, perforated leather seats, push button start, rear vents, chilled glove-box, and a decent stereo with USB/AUX/Bluetooth, and SAT radio. No matter how many times I look at the competition, thinking the grass is greener on the other side, there is still so much to like my car that honestly I am years away from replacing her, and when I do, it will remain in the family."
[Deleted User],Jan-14,"Here is the 2014 EX interior with the base Infotainment. $24,400 sticker. I know of no other car in this class, at this price that offers so much in a quality interior. SO the steering is rubbery and the handling falls short of sporty, but they get a lot right at the is price point...heck at any price point south of $30,000."
[Deleted User],Jan-14,"Sounds like I should invest in Aluminum, or Alcoa! Another future prediction is that cars will be printed from carbon fiber and plastic.
I can't find any hard figures on the 2.7 liter ecoboost, except that it has been extrapolated at 310 HP and (probably) 325 lb ft. Any more would infringe on the carryover 3.5 ecoboost.

explorerx4,Jan-14,2.7 sounds like it could be a good fit in the Explorer.
akirby,Jan-14,"For a sport model, sure. Otherwise the 2.3L EB would be the natural replacement for the 3.5L V6."
explorerx4,Jan-14,"I was thinking the 2.7 could use the extra torque to get the Explorer moving, compared to a mid size sedan."
[Deleted User],Jan-14,"I can't wait to see a high power Fusion, and a larger four should help it feel stronger off boost. One of the continuing complaints I hear over at the Optima site is poor off-boost 2.0 T performance.
The 2.3 EB is allegedly going in the new Mustang too, but not right away. C/D interviewed several Ford product planners and they said maybe in the 2016 to 2017 model year. In the meantime the 3.7 and 5.0 coyote continue on.
""Back in the day"" my girlfriend in HS had a Mustang SVO with the original 2.3 turbo. It was fast for the times, but broke down a lot. I don't remember the year, but it had the aero headlights and twin spoilers on the hatch, ala Mercur XR4Ti."
akirby,Jan-14,"The 2015 mustang is getting the 2.3L EB immediately as is the 2015 Lincoln MKC - no waiting. Consider that the 2.3L EB will make over 300 lb/ft of torque compared to the current Explorer/Edge's 3.5L which only makes about 280 lb/ft and you just don't need the 2.7L EB for the mainstream model.
An AWD 2.3L EB Fusion Sport with suspension tuning would be a screamer."

Man, where do you come up with this stuff? You gotta get another source besides C/D, I guess. LOL. The 2015 is getting the 2.3 ecoboost as an upcharge over the v6 and this has been widely reported during the last few weeks on just about every car website out there. For example:

benjaminh,Jan-14,"I think akirkby is right that Ford has a big head start in using aluminum. Ford CEO Alan Mulally, who previously was at Boeing, was obviously comfortable with working with the material. They began the F-150 project way back in 2009, and the truck itself won't be launched until Fall of 2014 as a 2015 model, and so that does represent 5 years and billions and billions of dollars of investment.
In terms of dollars and cents, however, it's not clear how much the customer will come out ahead. On the one hand, higher mpg and higher payloads will make the new F-150 more economical and more functional. But on the other hand, list prices will probably be at least $1000 more, and apparently insurance and repair costs will be higher. And so it seems like it will probably be the best truck on the market, but in terms of money savings it might end up being only a small benefit."

I used a local brush-less car wash about a week ago, but my wheels, tires, and wheel-wells still had dirt and brake dust all over them afterward. I politely talked to the manager about it, and he said that I would have to pay for the ""super wash"" ($18) if I wanted my wheels treated. WHAT??? I just want them clean. I will treat them myself. As far as I know, wheels are connected to the car, and I just want them washed!! Ugggh."

How you do that with reverse sensors and a wide angle rear view camera is beyond me.
We will work next week on getting it fixed.
At least they owned up to it.
Then, I noticed they put he wrong oil in the car, so I waited while they changed it again.
It looks like the just overwrote the 2 in 5w20 on the reminder sticker with a 3.
Not feeling too confident.
When I got home, I decided I should check the oil life indicator and of course it was not reset.
After the car cooled off, I checked the tire pressures. I had set them all last weekend.The front 2 were over inflated and the other 2 were each a different pressure.
It just keeps on getting better and better."

I had problems at my Kia dealer too, but only when asked to go beyond oil and filter change. Your dealer didn't even get the basics right and crashed your car as a bonus??? Oh sh**.
I still check the oil before I leave the dealer (to make sure they remembered to refill it) and then I check it again the next morning to make sure they didn't cross-thread the filter or forgot to put the oil plug back in. Also, I am familiar with the towel-off-the-caps method of ""topping off"" or ""checking"" your fluids.
Following up costs me nothing, especially after a Mobil station cross-threaded the filter in my '92 Saturn causing it to run out of oil downtown in DC, where there are zero gas stations. Nice."

Optima 's k-9 will compete with Hyundai's new redesign 2015 Genesis. I bought my 2013 Genesis, R-Spec sedan 5.0 in Nov, with 430 hp and 0-60 in 4.2 sec. This car is so fast its scary. On the highway from 30 to 100 in seconds.. I bought a 2013 model cause i did not like the new look of the 2015 model comming this spring. If you check out the Detroit Auto show they have a 30 min presentation by hyundai on this new redesign 2015 Genesis on sale in spring time at dealerships.. The list of standard/ tech features are very impressive for 45k. Lane departure system, CO2 sensors, heads up display on dash, pw train modes from, Auto to Sport to Eco to Awd system, New underbody structure, Senserory Surround braking system with fog and rain detection. 1100 watt 18 speaker with amp lexicon radio w, 7.1 surround system.. and the list goes on.
I have the 1000 watt 17 speaker 7.1 surround in my 2013 and it is by far one of the best radio's i have had in any high end vehicle.. The Bang olufsen system is a close comparison to this if you had a Audi or Bmw or lexus with mark levinson system..
What impressed me the most in this 2015 model was the new braking system with laser camera's front back and sides that will auto brake vehicle if the system detects on comming vehicle to close or a crash.. This system alerts when vehicles are comming from behind very fast next to you.. Great feature especially at night with the rain and fog..
Hyundai Genesis may be back on top in the 40 to 50k segment. lotta bang for your buck here..

nyccarguy,Feb-14,"@cski
I watched the introduction of the new 200 on Chrysler's Website. They really seem to have put ""all hands on deck"" for the 200. I hope they are incredibly successful. High quality interior materials, a sport edition, available V6, 9 speed automatic, available fully disconnecting AWD system, sharp styling... How did the exterior look in person?"
imidazol97,Feb-14,Did I hear right in the TV show about NAIAS that the 200 shares a platform with the Dart and a Jeep model?
stickguy,Feb-14,"Believe so. Yes on the Dart, and the new Cherokee is built on a version of that platform too."
Mr_Shiftright,Feb-14,"It had better be good, as it is competing in the ""family sedan"" market, which has formidable competition. But you can get the 300 HP V-6 with AWD, and that's something not many competitors can match. The 200 also shares the platform with the Alfa Romeo Giullieta. The ""old"" 200 was a pretty much nothing car, so this one has really got to improve on the name."
[Deleted User],Feb-14,"It looked great. It caught my attention from across the room. Very swoopy with the front end reminding me of the Lincoln MK-Z. The back end was really modern looking with a substantial built in spoiler, lighted reflector area above the integrated dual exhaust, and it just flowed really well. Very sporty, and the design made it look like a car costing thousands more. I think it will be a hit if Chrysler gets the driving dynamics and the interior assembly quality up to par with the rest of the field. I also noticed the giant infotainment screen, which is probably the same unit in many other current Chrysler platforms. Will America buy this one in droves? Or stay away like the Dart? Only time (and good reviews) will tell.
I also noticed the new Chevy SS. If you are looking for an understated hot-rod sport sedan this car is for you. It is the same size as a mid size sedan, looking very similar to the Malibu (almost to a fault). Interior and exterior assembly quality was excellent, and when they fired one up downstairs it attracted men like a moth to a flame. At $45k, it seems to be a great buy for a car reaching 60 in 4.6 seconds.
The new Mustang was really pretty too. They had a red EcoBoost 2.3 T on display, and while the design is evolutionary rather than revolutionary, Ford cut a lot of weight and finally added an IRS and very much improved interior materials, and MFT is now offered in a Mustang the first time. I think I would enjoy the 2.3 EB with 305 HP. It should get good FE and has plenty of power. Fords is gonna sell at ton of them, with big hopes for sales overseas.
Again though, I found the most attractive sedan to be the Impala 3.6 LTZ. It just ""did it"" for me. Why? Because I tend to like cars that I can actually afford, fit my whole family in comfort, and that is cost effective to maintain."
akirby,Feb-14,"The 200 is basically just a larger Dart - which isn't a bad thing. Much improved over the old one.
The Chevy SS will sell just as well as the Pontiac GTO and G8 - which is to say, not very well. It suffers from the same problem as the GTO and G8 - dowdy looks despite good performance.
Rumor has it they only brought over the Holden rebadge to throw a bone to the Aussies to make up for other transgressions and it will be a very limited run."

benjaminh,Feb-14,"As you know, I'm an Accord guy, but it sounds to me like the Honda folks were spinning. Still, the top 4 are all pretty close. The big news is that there's less than 1000 units between Camry and Altima. In December, the Accord took the lead for 1 month iirc. Could Fusion, Altima, or Accord take it in Feb? Unlikely, but possible imho."
stickguy,Feb-14,"couple thoughts on this. one is that Honda sells a ton in the NE, and our weather in january was horrid, so no surprise that sales up here stunk. And yeah, I am guessing that by around March dealers are going to be storing cars on the roof to make room for incoming stock, and there will be serious deals to be found.
One thing I do know from keeping an eye on the ads lately (being in the market), Toyota and Nissan (along with Hyundai) were cheap selling the heck out of their cars in January, especially lease offers on the Camry. I think if you walked into the dealer to use the bathroom, they just gave you a car to take home."
suydam,Feb-14,"Accords are made in Ohio and Ohio had record snow and cold in January, over 40 inches in Toledo, for example. All car sales are down due to the awful weather. Honda doesn't do much in the way of fleet sales so not to surprising their numbers suffered."

If Chrysler can sell 15,000 of those turkeys, they should do very well with the new 200.

Pricing discipline to be tested, analysts warn
....Now, after Ford added a second factory of Fusion production late last year, the challenge will be maintaining prices that Ford said average almost $24,000 a car. Fusion sales fell 8 percent last month.
Challenge coming
""The big challenge won't be until the first big automaker really breaks ranks on pricing and we approach a market top and we see how people deal with it,"" Wakefield said. ""Dealing with growing 5 percent or 10 percent a year is a lot different than dealing with a reduction.""
Scraping for sales in a slow market with bloated inventories could set off a price war, AutoNation's Jackson warned.
""High inventories, market-share ambitions, slower-growing market: The tinder is there this year,"" he said in an interview last month. ""The last four years haven't been a real test for the industry. This year will be a real test."""

This has me thinking ahead to when my lease is up. Living in CT and commuting to the Bronx every day really puts a value on AWD/4WD for me.

Thanks! I appreciate the heads up. My lease is up at the end of September, so I'll most likely be looking to buy (or lease) around Labor Day.
@dudleyr
Yes, you are correct. I made it through many winters in the suburbs of NYC with my trusty, (but never rusty) 2001 Honda Prelude Type SH with FWD, a 5-Speed Manual Transmission, & a set of (minus 1) Michelin Pilot Alpin snow tires mounted on 15"" steel wheels. 3 1/2 years ago I moved from my condo in Hartsdale, NY (Westchester County) to a house in Stamford, CT. They don't plow as well, they don't salt (people have well water), it is a little colder, we get more snow, have curvier back roads, and we've got a lot more hills... So I switched to AWD and haven't looked back. Regardless of the fact that I have AWD in my car and 4WD in my wife's SUV, I still drive cautiously in the snow & ice. I don't miss storing an extra set of tires & wheels plus having them switched 2x per year."
akirby,Feb-14,One thing Ford is not going to do is overproduce Fusions and drop the prices/increase incentives to move them. Any excess plant capacity in Flat Rock can be shared with Mustang and upcoming MKS and Taurus.

That's when I examined the center stack and found hugely misaligned panels, especially the nav screen, which had 1/4 to 1/2 inch gaps behind it just like C/D said. The interior materials were OK, but no where near as nice as my $10,000 less expensive Optima, or your $10,000 less Fusion."
explorerx4,Feb-14,"@dudleyr
We are sold on AWD. It's there when you need it all year long. No drama, no trying to figure out when should I put on the winter tires or take them off. It can maximize the tires that are mounted on the vehicle. I tried to spin the Edge a bit in a parking lot. It just cut the power to keep it going in a circle. It won't help you stop, but you have to getting moving first, then you worry about stopping."
dudleyr,Feb-14,4 snows get me going just fine. I enjoy not worrying about stopping - except for the guy behind me that can't stop.
nyccarguy,Feb-14,"@explorerx4
That's the perfect way to describe it. The AWD systems now are quite sophisticated and very transparent. 355 days a year my BMW's balanced, RWD chassis help it perform as advertised. When the weather turns white, I usually leave before the roads are plowed. I've got to open up at 7:30 AM.
Before so many manufacturers offered SUVs and cars with AWD, pick a house somewhere in New England. At least 1 car was a Jeep, Subaru, or Audi."

http://wardsauto.com/plants-amp-production/flat-rock-get-back-speed-ford-exec-says
....Ford shifted some Fusion production to Flat Rock in August to meet escalating demand for the sedan and soak up unused capacity at the facility. Previously, the car was built solely in Mexico.
But since then, Fusion sales have cooled, with inventories rising to a 97-day supply at the end of January, despite two weeks of downtime at the Flat Rock plant during the month and 3-weeks of shutdowns at the Hermosillo, Mexico, facility so far this year.
Flat Rock utilization ran at only 43% in 2013, but a WardsAuto forecast calls for that to increase to 68% with Fusion added to the mix for the full year....
“There's more capacity (for) Fusion than there are sales right now...."""

I always thought Ford was making better vehicles than GM.. Is it possible Gm has caught up?
Here in NYC/ 5 boro's. Our Sanatation dept has its offical car the Fusion. All white with orange and blue markings . I see alot of them thru the city. Mostly supervisor and bosses have them to check up on our garbage pick up and problems .
Ford has had a good run with there Crown vic's as yellow cabs in NYC for many years. Seems like as these cars get older they are being replaced with more Toyota hybrids, and Nissans.
Hey Gm Your no where to be found here????? Are you not in the car business..
Nissan new nv200 is the new mini/ box cab truck that has been approved to be one of the offical vehicles for city cabs. 12 thousand units will be made to start up production."
akirby,Feb-14,"GM is getting much better. The new Impala is impressive. But it seems to be hit and miss - some great products, some not so great. And still no regular hybrids from GM - just the Volt and ELR.
Ford has done more of an across the board improvement on almost every vehicle but they seem to be having more engineering and parts issues now although I think that's a product of an accelerated development cycle to get to common global platforms and ecoboost engines for CAFE compliance."
backy,Feb-14,"Depends what you mean by a ""regular"" hybrid. GM has been building ""mild"" hybrids for years, including the Malibu. Call these ""eAssist"" I think.

People flock to the Shell so they can make sure to get a full tank of gas, and then to the Safeway in droves to get 8 gallons of milk, 4 loaves of bread (and hopefully hot chocolate). Then home where every neighbor has an emergency full tank of gas in their cars, which of course will not be driven for days.

I'm waiting on word from them now as to how they are making it. Anyway we actually had snow and sleet and icey roads here which is very rare but happened 3 times in about 3 weeks and i'm in extreme south Louisiana. The first time this year no one was prepared even though it was predicted by the weather service, we get that sort of thing so rarely that hardly anyone took heed. Well after 777 auto accidents and I think 6 deaths accross the state attributed to black ice the next one a week later shut down nearly everything. The state police and all the local law enforcement agencies took so much heat for not closing the bridges and elevated road ways the first time didn't mess around the second go around. Things closed early and for sure here where I live and the next parrish over a curfew was set, you get caught on the hiway you will be stopped, period! I am a coordinator for an oilfield support company and we could not ship anything in or out for 3 1/2 days. That made the oilfield here come to a screatching halt.
Why did I write all that mess you say? Well I have what I call a brand new 2014 Optima SX-T and there is no way I would risk taking that thing on the road in that garbage weather. Down here there is no roads or Interstates to travel on without crossing a bunch of bridges and elevated roadways over water ""BLACK ICE"". 9 times out of 10 you can't see it till you are in it then it's to late, no control over your vehicle at all get off the gas and grab your butt with both hands and pray. Most of our overpasses, bridges and elevated roadways are posted "" will freeze before hiway"" or something like that. So if you travel to Louisiana and have in mind you don't have to worry about slipping and sliding on the hiway, please use extreme caution in the winter during freeze conditions it can fool you and it will get you!! Another thing, some people are under the assumption it doesn't get cold here, well for all you snow birds that migrate south for the winter months if you come here I suggest you bring some cloths. Our 30 degrees with 30 MPH wind gusts and drizzle with fog will cut you to the bone, I promise. My oldest daughter and her family live in Alaska and they go out and play in below zero temps and she will tell you, it is much colder at home in Louisiana than there if you have to be in it for extended periods. This damp cold gets to you. We have a little saying down here that goes like this, "" if you don't like the weather today you will probably love it tomorrow"".

Hope you all drive safe in the snow - it can be very tough with no equipment to clear the roads. Probably very few people have snow tires as well. Some of the worse driving conditions can be in the South especially when you combine a few people from snowy areas showing off with many locals that don't have much experience in the snow."

suydam,Feb-14,"Ground clearance is definitely an issue. I have friends with Jeeps who drive over snow-covered driveways I wouldn't even attempt with a Honda. That said, in the typical roads that are non-salted with 3 or so inches that we tend to have before plows get to them, the Honda has done very well. I'm in Ohio and we've had continuous snow on the ground since November."
[Deleted User],Feb-14,"I guess Ohio is probably very similar to Buffalo in the snowfall and temperature department. That leads me to a big question.
Rust.
How do you handle rust up in the great lakes states as it pertains to car buying and car maintenance? Which cars are the best at repelling rust, and how does one go about buying a local used car? I have lived here in VA since I was 5 so I am just curious.
The only example I know of dealing with it (off the top of my head) is my cousin in Erie. He bought a nice 25 year old home that has a 2 car garage with sloped, heated floors with a drain in the middle. Every time he came home, he washed all the salt off his car before pulling in the garage, (from heated water inside) instead of the outdoor spigot, which is obviously going to be shut off for the winter. Then he would pull in and finish up w/o flooding the place. A very elegant and practical way of protecting his cars.
I have heard that the Mazda 3 is terrible from rust, and that Honda's rust faster than Toyota's, and that GM pickups are better than Fords. Stuff like that, but I think you may be a better source!"
m6user,Feb-14,"I've lived in Michigan and Illinois all my life and have had over 35 different cars/trucks/motorcycles. Rust hasn't really been much of a problem since about 1995. I've kept two or three of the more recent vehicles for 10 years or more and haven't had any trouble with rust. I never do any kind of rinsing at home and only wash the car a handful of times during the winter. I have a 2003 p/u in my driveway that doesn't have a speck of rust and it is what, almost 12 years old. I think when the weather is very cold it is better to just let the stuff stay frozen rather than constantly thawing it out with warm water. I've never rustproofed either as I believe it is not necessary for one and two I've read where rustproofing can plug up weepholes and actually cause more damage than one is trying to avoid.
The Mazda3 did have a problem but that was about 10 years ago it wasn't even called the Mazda3 then but the Protege. As far as Hondas rusting faster than Toyotas I have no idea but I would guess that is very old information too as I can remember very early Hondas(like in the 70s) rusting very badly but nothing like that in modern times so to speak. Same with GM and Ford pickups. Some of these old problems live on by people repeating them and don't apply today. Kind of like the rep Hyundai had for the first 10 years in the U.S. and now they are accepted as fairly reliable vehicles. I like to deal with factual, more recent information. I could say that ""I heard"" Hyundai/Kia are pieces of sh$$ which would be true if I was talking 10-15 years ago but not now."

And no, I am not an idiot just driving into potholes willy-nilly. Hard to judge their depth at night, and it is so easy to forget they are there in an area that usually does not have to worry about them at all.
I have much respect for snow belt dwellers, and for the cars that endure it and still clean up good in the spring. These cars have come a long way from the rust buckets I saw in Buffalo in the late 70's-early 80's."

DETROIT -- Ford Motor Co. has been raising incentives on the Fusion sedan to help clear out growing inventories, just months after it started building the car in a second North American plant to keep up with demand.
In many parts of the country, the Fusion is now offered with zero-percent financing for 60 months plus $1,000 cash back....
""The car is selling, but not as fast as they're building them,"" said Larry Taylor, the owner of Beau Townsend Ford in Vandalia, Ohio, and a former member of the Ford dealer council. ""They've buried us.""....

akirby,Feb-14,It's not that bad - they only have about 88 days inventory on hand. Most other midsized sedans are much higher than that.
serenity185,Feb-14,"Yeah, a few dealerships in the Twin Cities are offering the Fusion at up to $4-5 K off MSRP. I was surprised, as I always hear of how expensive they are in comparison to other midsize sedans. However, compared to such competitors as the Accord and 6, it's actually less expensive, as I'm not seeing anywhere near $4-5k discounts on those models. It sure makes the Fusion a tempting choice, but I have no idea how reliable the 1.5 Ecoboost will be after hearing about all the problems with the 1.6 Ecoboost.
And ab348, I have been reading more about Mazda's rust issues, and it's almost scaring me out of a 2014 Mazda 6. I live in Minnesota where the roads are salted and where my car is outside 24/7. My 2007 Accord has held up very well (it helps that it's Carbon Bronze Pearl, so it doesn't show the dirt), so to think of even the possibility of a rust issue on a new car is unsettling."
suydam,Feb-14,I had an '04 Mazada 6 wagon that is still on the road and doing fine. I also owned a '90 Mazda 626 and an '88 323. Each lasted well over 100k. All were kept outside. We have cold winters and live in a rural area. I would have no hesitation about buying another Mazda. Today's cars of any make are so much better now than they were 20 years ago.
ab348,Feb-14,"Mazda's rust problems seemed to be model-specific. The Mazda 3 had terrible rust issues. Mazda fans say that the company made changes around 2007 or 2008 that addressed them, but it is still too soon to say for sure. They also had problems with the minivan and the Mazda 5. The 6 seemed largely immune, but it was made in a different plant (Ford's Flat Rock site). The new one is no longer made there, so who knows."
[Deleted User],Feb-14,"Anyway, there are 2 layer covers all the way up to 6 layer. I found an Optima specific, 4 layer cover on eBay for 31.95 with free shipping. It has a fleece lining and mirror pockets. Too good to be true?"
backy,Feb-14,"I have a 2005 Mazda6 that's seen 10 Minnesota (Twin Cities) winters, 9 with its previous owner, in 165k miles and no signs of rust on it yet. From its appearance, I think it was cared for well by its previous owner, a woman, and I wash it as often as I can in the winter but THIS winter has been a real challenge to keep salt off a car for any length of time, as you know.
I also have a 10-year-old Elantra GT, and it has only a quarter-sized spot of rust near the rear license plate. I think automakers in general have been doing a better job in making cars rust resistant in the past 10 years or so. It used to be that every older Honda you'd see in the Twin Cities would be rusty. The engines would last forever, but the body... not so much. But I haven't noticed that as much in the past 10 years or so."
explorerx4,Feb-14,"@cski
The car should be clean before you cover it, so you still would have to wash a lot.
I've toying with the idea of getting a Fusion with less power, so I took a look at some hybrids today.
Definitely would want the 18 inch wheels. SE doesn't look quite was good as a Titanium, but i could live with it.
Incentives are a lot less on a hybrid, but I could make that up in fuels savings in about 3 years.
Just thinking about things, at this point."
[Deleted User],Feb-14,"Well, I would imagine the new Mazda 6 is being made in a very modern factory with state of the art rustproofing of it's high strength steel components. Don't get scared. It is a great car. I think it is made in Mazda's Yamaguchi plant in Japan."
[Deleted User],Feb-14,"I have noticed that the Fusion 17"" rims look like the optima 16's. They are not commiserate with the cars beautiful design. I would want the 18"" and the 2.0T. It is on the heavy side. However, a hybrid electric motor has 100% of it's torque available at 0 (zero) rpm, and would save me a ton of money at the pump due to my congested city driving. If you like to take long trips though, the battery and electric motor are dead weight on the highway. If it was my money I would still buy the SE 2.0T. To be honest, I don't like the center stack on the Fusion. All those flat panel ""clicky"" buttons just doesn't do it for me. I want knurled knobs, more like an Audi."

Sonata drags down Hyundai
Brand ranks near the bottom on 2014 J.D. Power dependability study

Automotive News
February 24, 2014
LOS ANGELES -- Hyundai notched big gains in its sales, market share and image when its swoopy 2011 Sonata hit the market. But barely three years later, the mid-sized car has left Hyundai with a black eye.
Problems reported by owners of the 2011 Sonata were the main reason that the Hyundai brand ranked fifth from the bottom in the latest dependability rankings from J.D. Power and Associates....

ivan_99,Feb-14,"So they're ranked 27th now...but if you look at the site you'll see that their problems per 100 vehicles is around the same as it was 5 years ago when they were ranked 14th.
It's just that everybody else has raised their reliability (or decreased their problems per 100 vehicles).
I've used this argument previously when defending VW's ranking...for me it's a wash when it's under 200 problems per 100 vehicles.
Most cars have over 100 problems per 100 vehicles. So odds are you're going to have to go to the dealer to get an item fixed; you'll have the inconvenience of taking your car to the dealer no matter what you buy. So if you're under 200 problems per 100 vehicles...then you just tell the dealer, ""fix this AND that"" instead of saying ""fix ONLY this"".
But as a general statement...less defects is better (especially after warranty period)."
m6user,Feb-14,"I really don't know if JD Powers takes into consideration what kind or how serious a ""problem"" might be but it would make a difference to me. Having a very minor problem taken care of during the first oil change at the dealer is a lot different than having to leave your car for three days because of a serious safety recall or a ""do not drive"" type of thing."
benjaminh,Feb-14,"I think the Sonata probably has pretty good reliability. As ivan said, it's just that some of the other brands have improved even faster."
explorerx4,Feb-14,"I'm pretty sure the Sonata was an all new design, at the very least a huge jump forward for Hyundai, so first year problems are to be expected."
[Deleted User],Feb-14,Replying to m6user: Right. The one problem I had was the center console latch was partially broken. $2 part warranty repair.
backy,Feb-14,"I've had 0 problems on my wife's 2013 Sonata in 15 months. Maybe Hyundai fixed the ""bugs"" by then."
[Deleted User],Feb-14,"Many people reached by the JD power surveys will put things down that may aggravate them, but are not actually broken. Like ""my phone will not connect to cars Bluetooth sometimes"". Well, mine does that sometimes too, and is a known issue, but is generally a setting problem somewhere in the setup. That's a lot different than say a CEL code issue."
lovmycar,Feb-14,"I can only comment with first hand news on Hyundai/Kia since 2009 when I bought a new 2009 Sonata SE with a v-6, great car now my EX has it. I opted for a Optima to replace it and have now replaced that one with a 2014 Optima SX-T. I have nothing but good to say about all three of them. This one I have now is absolutely awesome, smooth, quiet and handles like a dream.
Power wise it is unreal, this thing will get you in trouble, lol ""use the cruise""!!"
brian125,Feb-14,"lovmycar,
Kia, Hyundai have come along way. They give you alot of car for your money with a 5 yr peice of mind bumper to bumper and 10 yr powertrain. Its always a great thing to be able to sell your car within 5 years and the new owner still has piece of mind on the warranty.
My 2013 Genesis R-spec sedan is 430hp fast, super quite inside no road noise, , awesome sound system, and sharp looking . Spent 43k on a car that other competitors get 60 to 70 grand.
But again its only a Hyundai..... What would i know about nice cars.?............lol
Enjoy your new ride its a sharp looking car............... just dont try and race me."
scotty49,Feb-14,"Looking for a source of info (reliability, power, quietness) for 2014 Buick Verano, Chevy Malibu and Ford Fusion. Looking for a car that is quiet, and power for mountain driving. I drove a Malibu LTZ, and found it a little noisy and a little weak on power at 7500-8500 feet pass climbing, but acceptable. Trying to get ideas of other cars to compare with. I consider all three cars very nice inside and outside, but any other ideas on a $25,000 car to look at would be appreciated."
explorerx4,Feb-14,A turbo car will lose less power at high altitudes.
akirby,Feb-14,Fusion 2.0L EB is quiet with plenty of power and the turbo should help at altitude. Reliability on the 2014s is much better than the 2013s.
brian125,Feb-14,"scotty49,
The only other cars to maybe consider in that category are lower end models
Accord , Camry, legacy, Maxima........ OR Sonata, Optima"
[Deleted User],Feb-14,"Verano is technically a ""compact luxury sedan"", and is going to be a bit smaller in the back, as it shares its platform with the Chevy Cruze. Powertrain wise, both the Verano and the Malibu are comparable with the mid-size segment. The Malibu also has a smaller back seat than the competition, as it's wheelbase is shorter than the pack. This was done in order to make room for the new Impala., which is classified as ""large sedan"".
Complicated. I would compare the Accord Touring and Optima SX-T myself.
I do have a question. I see under your profile that you have 4 late model cars. Obviously you can afford what you want. Have you ever driven and Audi A6 3.0T ? Awesome, and starts at $42k."
imidazol97,Feb-14,"@cski said:
The Malibu also has a smaller back seat than the competition, as it's wheelbase is shorter than the pack.
The backseat myth seems to have floated around because the previous generator Malibu has a very generous back seat area for a midsize car. But the 2013/2014 has a seat better than a couple of cars cited as equivalents in the market.
Malibu Legroom 36.8 in
Optima legroom 34.6 in
Sonata legroom 34.7 in
If I recall the Malibu is rated 36 mpg while I noticed the Sonata/Opt are rated 35 mpg with the standard engines.
I didn't compare with Honda and Camry. I assume they have slightly more legroom.
show previous quotes
I drove a Malibu LTZ, and found it a little noisy and a little weak on power at 7500-8500 feet pass climbing, but acceptable.
Which engine did it have? 2.5 or the 2.0 turbo. The Verano also is available with the 2.0 turbo. The Sonato and Optima both have turbo available."
brian125,Feb-14,"Here is my Accord exl v-6 brerakdown

Buying at 25k gets you lower end versions of prior above mentioned cars.
If you could spend 27k excluding taxes Buying a Honda Accord exl V6 gets you the best midsize car in its class IMHO. and most car reviews agreeing..The Ford Fusion might be egual in price/ size, and mpg. Reliability, Build , and Resale may be a different story thou.
Otherwise Sonata and Optima could be the next best choices."
[Deleted User],Feb-14,"I have to admit that I am smitten by the 2013-14 MK-Z. I love the back end (I like taillights that go all the way across in general). I didn't realize that you can pick up a base 2.0T for $35,000.
That is not far off the upper echelon price of our fine group of sedans. With about $6000 of equity, I could actually afford it.
I found a pic of the interior I like. I really wish it had SOME buttons (even hidden ones), but the designers went hi-tech and sleek. It works for me in the looks department."
benjaminh,Feb-14,"cski: I actually like the MKZ too. And it's a lot of car for the money. But I think it also has the same flaw that the Optima has: poor rear visibility. There's a big thing among some car stylists these days for thick rear pillars and a high belt-line, which gives kind of a ""cocoon"" feeling of being enclosed that I'm not fond of. People in other cars can't see in very well, but at the same time the driver and passengers in the MLZ can't see out that well either."
m6user,Feb-14,"I just read that the 2015 Focus is substantially going back to buttons because Ford is just getting crucified for that touch screen, touch dash capacitance sliding whatever stuff that people hate. They went back to buttons recently on the F-150 too. I would bet money that this will make it's way to the Fusion and the MKZ very shortly."
benjaminh,Feb-14,m6user: how do you like your Mazda6? What kind of mpg are you getting? Manual or auto. Really like the looks of that car. To me it's the best looking midsize car right now. And Mazda is really on a roll with their Skyactiv engineering.
akirby,Feb-14,The climate control buttons and dials are going back to the center stack and no more capacitive touch controls. That should be the new design as vehicles get new/redesigned interiors.
lovmycar,Feb-14,"brian125,
I gave up racing many years ago but if I still did there is one car I would own, the Cadillac
CTS-V. We are in a whole different world in this thread with 2.0 so I won't say anymore about racing."
m6user,Feb-14,"Ours is old with 109,000. It's a 2007 with the auto I4. We average about 28 mpg with it with about 33 on the highway. It's been a super car and is the first Mazda product we've had but am definitely looking at replacing it this year and the new Mazda6 is on the list. My wife drives it back and forth to work(she absconded with it about 6 months after I bought it) and the only thing she wants different in her next car is for it to be quieter. I'm pretty sure the newer ones are quieter just like the new Accords are much quieter than the older ones. The Accord Hybrid is also on our list. I drive a newer Acura and have had just super experience with that too.
The Mazda has had no repairs, just maint. unless you want to count a couple of light bulbs as repairs. I don't think I've ever had a car that went this many years and this many miles with no repairs(knock on wood) and I've had a bunch of vehicles. The only other car she has mentioned is a BMW but we tend to keep cars a long time and I don't want to pay for expensive out of warranty repairs that are pretty much standard with the German cars."
stickguy,Feb-14,"I got the auto issue of C-R today so read it through. The Accord was top rated in this class, but the mazda was only about 2 points behind. And for mileage, the Accord got an impressive 30 overall in their tests, but the 6 beat that out getting 32 (and no CVT!)
The 6 would be high on my list if I was to buy new, assuming I wanted to go up a size class from the 3. Almost as good mileage, but quite a bit roomier, and probably cheaper real-world if you want the 2.5l engine."
benjaminh,Mar-14,"Most comparisons of midsize cars have put either the Mazda first or the Accord first. If you're considering between those two it's a tough choice! Here are a few points....
Style: almost everyone would agree that the Mazda is more stylish, although the Accord, esp. the Sport model, is a classy looking ride.
MPG: There's a slight edge for the Mazda6 here, although actually the auto versions are both rated by the epa at 30 mpg combined.
Price: virtual tie. The Mazda6 auto has an msrp starting at $22,695, while the Accord auto starts at $22,755.
Safety: Slight edge for the Accord, as it's the only midsize car to get a Good rating on the small-offset crash test by the IIHS.
Acceleration: Slight edge for the Mazda in some tests.
Handling: Slight edge for the Mazda in most tests.
Interior room: Slight edge for the Accord, as it has a roomier back seat area. Passenger volume is 103.2 for the Accord compared to 99.7 for the 6.
Visibility: Slight edge for the Accord.
Luggage space: 15.8 cu ft. for the Accord vs. 14.8 for the Mazda6
Reliability and durability: Probably a tie
Service: There are a lot more Honda dealers than Mazda dealers in the US, and so service is probably easier with the Honda.
Both cars are great choices imho."
benjaminh,Mar-14,"One last point, which probably isn't a consideration for many people, is that the Accord is made in Ohio while the Mazda6 is made in Japan. I'm old-fashioned, but it gives me a good feeling to know that the money I spend on a car is keeping jobs going and money circulating in the US."
Mr_Shiftright,Mar-14,"Don't forget to thank the government for that benjamin...the 'build it here"" phenomenon was in response to threats of higher tariffs on imports, back when Japan was eating American manufacturers alive, in the 1980s."
stickguy,Mar-14,one wild card though on durability. It remains to be seen if the Honda CVT is going to be bulletproof or a time bomb.
backy,Mar-14,"On reliability... CR says the only Accord model with at least average predicted reliability as a new car is the 4 cylinder sedan. The others are either worse than average or much worse than average... quite a departure for Honda. The most reliable mid-sized cars, per CR, are the Camry Hybrid and the 4-cylinder Legacy, followed by the 4-cylinder Camry and Mazda6.
As far as overall score, the Camry Hybrid and XLE V6 are actually CR's top choices, followed by the Accord LX 4-cylinder and EX-L V6 (although that model is not recommended due to reliability issues). Then one point behind the Accord are the Sonata 2.0T (also not recommended due to reliability issues) and the Sonata GLS, tied with the Malibu 2LTZ 2.0T. Then the Camry LE, and finally the Mazda6 Sport, Fusion SE Hybrid (not recommended due to subpar reliability), and then all the rest."

Just want to follow up on my last comments in Jan.. I drove the the 2014 mazda touring model a few days ago and i agree Mazda has done a very nice job with this vehicle. My son who drives a infinity G37's liked this model, but disliked engine a little underpowered, center stack was confusing, and hard ride.
What i liked and i agree with my son was the 11 speaker bose system in the touring model. 19' tires. I really liked the smaller wheel, upscale interior and mazda new smart city brake system. what this does is when vehicle is going 20mph or less if a frontal collision is detected it will apply the brakes. The Mazda Handled better than my EXL V-6 Accord. Mazda's radio blew away the hondas radio system. But i still feel My accord has less road noise , Rides better on harsh roads, and is alot faster. Accord has a little more interior room. Mazda has a bad track record on interior noise. This model was a upgrade
My only problem and this is why i would not buy this Mazda... The Ride / suspension We felt every bump in this car. On nice level roads here in the nyc area which there are not many of lol.., the mazda rode nice otherwise i cant be in a everyday vehicle like this. This kind of ride is not for me anymore.
Maybe the hard ride was worse due to the 19' tires on the touring model dont know. This mazda did handle very well. i think the younger kids will love this vehicle..... just not for me.
Id love to hear from someone who drove the lower end model with the 16' / 17' tires

benjaminh,Mar-14,"On one leg of a trip we took yesterday we hit 40 mpg in our 2013 Accord CVT. It was about a 70 mile stretch of Interstate between Cincinnati and Columbus. The car had three passengers + luggage, and we were going c. 62-72 mph on that leg. The AC was shut off, but we were running the heater and the stereo. I think in our 2008 Accord 4 cylinder we would have gotten about 31 mpg for this trip, and so that's a pretty good improvement in one generation of car. It makes me wonder what the next generation of Accord, due in 2018, will be able to do on a highway trip...? (Click on the image to see a more readable version of the trip computer.) This is a new record for us on mpg for a normal highway trip. I should say though that that stretch of highway is pretty flat, and conditions were dry and close to ideal. On the way back we were battling through the winter storm that's just hit (Titan?) and the mpg was significantly lower: c. 33-36."
brian125,Mar-14,"ben
I also had a 2008 Accord. Never got 31 mpg. When I traveled from NY to my house in Myrtle beach I was getting between 25 to maybe 28 mpg. This was cruising at 75 and at times close to 85 when conditions permited. I would think if i set the cruise at 65 i could get 30 mpg.
My dad was in the Oil business he retired in 1985. I always remember him telling me that American car companies have the technologies to make cars get better gas mileage but wont til the goverment forces them to produce and make them more efficient. I guess we will never know how much money was given under the tables from the oil bigs to car manufactorers, Lobbyists and gov't to keep things status quo all those years. These vehicles that are out today my dad spoke of years ago."

Well, even the LX now has alloys....so thats progress."

[Deleted User],Mar-14,"I for one would like to see more diesel models available in the US, but our stringent EPA regulations requiring expensive urea injection systems to keep the emissions clean, among other things, make offering them less attractive to manufacturers. They are slowly becoming more common and prices are slowly coming down. I would buy a BMW 335d if conditions were right. Also, I was really pining for the new Mazda 6 with it's 2.2 liter twin scroll diesel making upwards of 300 lb-Ft and 180 hp. I am still waiting for it to hit showrooms.
Here is a good explanation of why we do not get the same great compact diesels that Europe does (other than the fact that gas costs $8.00 a gallon in western EU).

benjaminh,Mar-14,"Given that diesel costs more per gallon, sometimes there's not much of a case for diesel in terms of saving money.
For example, a new Mazda6, Honda Accord, and Nissan Altima all have lower annual gas costs according to the EPA than a VW Passat diesel. The Passat diesel gets c. 3-5 more mpg, but the higher cost of diesel completely wipes out any savings. And since a Passat diesel costs c. $2000-$3000 more than a comparably equipped Altima, Accord, or Mazda6, you pay a premium for savings that don't really exist.
If you're in love with diesel for other reasons, like torque, or because you never want to change spark plugs, or you want to help VW gain market share, then good on ya. But if you're buying a diesel to save money, then right now it's a tough case to make since the new generations of gas cars get such good mpg."

brian125,Mar-14,"I'd like to chime in on sticks comment. He is right on about the dollar . I have bought and closed many deals for family, friends and friends of friends for over 40 years maybe well over one thousand vehicles bought across the country. I always said in these forums when you look at buying a new vehicle every dealer sells the same product.. lowest price closest to your home wins 9 out of 10 times. Many times my friends would give me 2 or 3 models and what ever car is the cheapest they wanted.
Benjaminh is correct but he forgot to mention Kia , and Hyundai in the up comming price wars.
If you read thru this months Cr reports on cars, trucks I'm amazed how many different vehicles are not such a bad choice after all. Im not a guy who care's much about MPG, I like my cars/ suv's, roomy , quiet, and fast but thats me. someone else who travels needs mpg or wants a sport tuned ride etc.
If Honda doesn't want to discount there vehicles with deeper rebates/ incentives folks will look elsewhere. Perfect example Nissan and Toyota this month are outselling hondas best midsize car.. Its all about $$$$$$$$$$ Saved for most. I have had many folks emailing me saying Hey Brian I'm done with Honda and the nonsense and games they play with us...... Going for that Nissan or Hyundai."
ivan_99,Mar-14,"You're right. I probably wouldn't choose the Altima (I'm not in the market now and haven't compared them all...so who knows), but I took notice a couple days ago when a local Nissan dealer TV advertisement indicated $5000 off of MSRP.
If it truly was $5k less than the competition (and not their ""S"" demo model, etc) then I may not even go drive the others; that is a significant discount."
benjaminh,Mar-14,"Hey Brian: I don't understand what you mean by Honda's ""nonsense and games""? They don't allow options, but that's how they've done things since the 70s. Having trim lines instead of thousands of combinations of options simplifies manufacturing, lowers costs, and increases quality. This allows them to offer a somewhat better and somewhat more reliable car than most of their competitors for just a little bit more money. Honda's engineering, imho, is at or near the best in most areas. Their prices seem fair for what they are offering. To me it's the others who are getting into games with 0% plus money on the hood, but there's no doubt it helps move the metal! And if Honda wants to stay in the game, they'll probably need to increase their incentives a little. But mainly Honda is selling their cars on being a good value for a slightly better car, rather than selling on the lowest possible price. I think there's still a segment of the market that will pay a little bit more for a better car. The bottom line is that Honda is moving just a little bit upmarket compared to, say, a Camry, and to me that's a good thing...."
brian125,Mar-14,"I have done deals on cars for as little as 800 less than the other brand. go figure.. I would bet anything that the members who have the new Sonata are happy the Fusion or Optima with little complaint.
Maybe down the road 5, 6 years when the vehicle is aging you might say this might not of been a good choice. There are many vehicles that i would Never buy but when you read about people who have these vehicles and are happy with them i say to myself maybe i was the foolish one to spend that extra 5 or 10 k. LOL"
brian125,Mar-14,"Honda dealerships across the country while some are good decent dealerships alot more are into deceiving folks on price, lying to get them into the dealerships and there unwillingness to sell there vehicles cheaper in some area's. If your area is sellling at xxx price i will show you how to get the dealers best price in your area. THEN its up to you if you want to buy in your area or broaden your dealership search maybe going out of state for a better deal.. Alot of people in these forums fall into the trap of seeing other posters claim they got 1500 below invoice price. But in there area or state dealerships are selling at 400 below invoice price.. So they try like hell to get that 1500 and have a hard buying process.
Honda makes a great product they refuse to discount like the other car brands and why should they if they can get it.. Like you mentioned in your above post the other car companies will push honda to lower there profit margin and price by offering deeper cuts and incentives. There are alot of good choice's today so honda even thou reports claim they have the best overall midsize vehicle sales seem to be driven by price in the midsize market."

benjaminh,Mar-14,"New 2015 Sonata due in several months. Some stuff from the Hyundai press release:
http://www.autoblog.com/2014/03/04/2015-hyundai-sonata-teaser/#continued
.....SAFETY
The all-new Sonata reinforces its safety in crash tests with an improved body structure and rigidity, while other advanced features also contribute to enhancing the vehicle's overall safety.
By expanding on the application of Advanced-High Strength Steel (AHSS), which is twice as rigid yet 10 percent lighter than regular steel, the all-new Sonata achieves upgraded safety and driving performance.
The all-new Sonata's platform is now 51 percent AHSS, while the previous model had only 21 percent. In particular, most AHSS uses are for components designed to protect passengers, which works to achieve top-class safety in all aspects.
Furthermore, connection within the car frame has been strengthened by increasing the use of structure adhesive by more than 10 times than previous models and the addition of dual member structures in main parts of the body. Moreover, hot-stamping components are used three times more than for the previous model, and the hot-stamped double-section structure on the B-pillar hugely improves safety in crash tests.
Through these changes, the all-new Sonata's torsional and bending stiffness has been increased more than 40 percent compared to its predecessor. Internal tests suggest that the all-new Sonata will score ""Good"" at IIHS's small overlap test...."

http://www.autoblog.com/2014/03/03/2014-honda-accord-v6-touring-review/#continued
""....Having driven nearly all of this year's midsize contenders, we can say there's no other family sedan on the market with mechanicals that operate in such harmony. From the powertrain to the transmission to the suspension to the steering, all of the Accord's subsystems are on the same page with each other from the moment the start button is pressed. Most of its competitors nail one or two of these disciplines, but rarely do they come close to a complete package like the Accord (the Mazda6 is the exception, though which is better is close enough to be a matter of taste). What's more, there's even a six-speed manual transmission still available on LX, EX and Sport models, though the EX-L V6 and our Touring tester are only available with this well-tuned six-speed automatic...."""
[Deleted User],Mar-14,"OMG. The only car that couldn't make it up the hill on our local Fairfax Co Pkwy was a late model BMW.
Looked like he didn't know that summer tires are for...ummm, summer. Lowering it couldn't have helped either."
[Deleted User],Mar-14,WOW! Altima in the lead? I didn't expect that.
benjaminh,Mar-14,And the Optima is ahead of the Sonata.
benjaminh,Mar-14,"Seems like an impressive structural upgrade for the next gen Sonata. I assume Optima will get a similar boost. Now, if only they'd get rid of the blind spot. It would be nice imho to see Optima looking a bit more like BMW with a Hofmeister kink...
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofmeister_kink"
[Deleted User],Mar-14,"benjaminh - I appreciated the article on the Accord Touring, I think the front and rear of the car are very understated and stylish. I like the looks of the car, but not the center stack, or the Touring wheels, and I would not want the 3.5 with the cylinder deactivation, or the Adaptive Cruise based on the article. I would like the cameras. The wheels are not commiserate with a $32,000 car. I would either buy the Sport for $23.500 (which looks like I spent more), or mosey over to Mazda and cut them a check, sticking with the naturally aspirated 4 and the 6 speed auto.
The Touring just has bells and whistles that have too many odd side effects that would scare me in operation, and down the line when it came to repairs...especially the cylinder deactivation, and the weird-in-the-real-world Adaptive Cruise operation."
benjaminh,Mar-14,"cski: I like the touch screen set up. I don't have the touring, but our exl navi has that stuff, and it works pretty well for me. To state the obvious, it's best to program in an address before you start the car actually moving. And if you do that, the touchscreen turns into a little keypad for typing letters and numbers. It's handy, and much quicker than the last gen Honda navi, which we also own. When it's on audio, the touch screen buttons are also nice, because they are extra large and high up on the dash. Depending on which function you are using, perhaps it is sometimes little complicated, but guess what--cars that are this loaded to the gills have a lot of toys and functions you get to control, and so a certain number of controls are needed imho.
We don't have the adaptive, and so I can't comment on that.
I like the exl and touring wheels ok, but they are rather understated, and might be seen as plain. Honda puts the real money into other stuff--like the engine, transmission, body, suspension, etc., all of which are at or near the top of the class."
benjaminh,Mar-14,"So an all-new Sonata is coming out for MY 2015. Will there also be an all-new Optima?
Were they synchronized last time? In other words, this generation of Sonata went on sale in early 2010 as a 2011 model. That was already four years ago. Did the new Optima also go on sale in 2010 as a 2011, or did this gen Optima come out a year later?"
[Deleted User],Mar-14,"1) The Optima came out in 2011 also. The Sonata preceded the Optima availability nine showrooms by 6 months. The first one I ever saw was wrapped in heavy saran wrap at the dealer while mom bought a Forte'. I fell in love with the lines.
2) I just saw a commercial with an Optima owner backing into the garage... with a box of kids stuffed animals behind the car... anyway he gets close to hitting it and then they show the screen in the center stack and the view through the camera. Crying child averted.
Backing up the Optima is terrifying w/o the camera. I hate it. I eventually learned to aim my mirrors for lane changes, but backing up they might as well have just omitted the rear window.
3) Benjaminh - I didn't mean to rag on the Accord. I just responded to the article and the reviewers opinions. After sitting in the Accord at the auto show I kind of like my stack setup better. I try to be honest about everything and look at everything objectively. I would almost rather have your center stack in exchange for better visibility."
benjaminh,Mar-14,"Passat SEL with 1.8 turbo gets a good review from Auto Week....
""....EDITOR WES RAYNAL: This here is a fine winter car. It goes great in the snow, has a heck of a heater and terrific heated seats -- all the comforts one needs. When the weather is like this, that's about all I'm asking.
I prefer my Passats with the diesel, but this combo isn't bad. True, Passats are a bit dull to look at inside and out (kind of making the diesel the main selling point), but are well built, roomy as any other midsize car out there if not more so (materials could use a slight upgrade, but only slight), and the turbo four has plenty of oomph. The mpg indicator on the dash said I got 29 mpg commuting on surface streets. That's only 1 mpg less than the last time I drove the diesel.
Diesel or gas, the Passat flows down the road, quiet and smooth. I've read some other reports -- not ours -- that the engine isn't mated well to this gearbox, it doesn't shift smoothly and whatnot. I did not experience that. I thought it was fine. The engine/trans relationship and drivability are class competitive.
There are other virtues. The navigation/stereo screen works well. The seats are comfy. The trunk is huge....""

benjaminh,Mar-14,"I was intrigued by VW's high mpg prototype Passat that got 42 mpg. They did it by giving the car a 1.4 turbo 4 that would shut off two cylinders at highway speed. The problem is that their 1.4 really was not powerful enough for a 3200+ lb car. But I can see engineers taking this route in the future. If you could get the weight down to 3000 lbs by using high strength steel, aluminum, and composite materials, and then maybe going with a 1.6 turbo, you probably could still get to around a 42 epa rating on the highway. And since many Accord owners are able, in admittedly ideal conditions, to get 40 on the highway with a car rated at 36, then with a car rated at 42 you might be able to get, say, c. 46 mpg or so with a regular gas car with midsize room. On the highway, at least, that's close to Prius mpg. City numbers, obviously, would be more like 30--but that's still getting what a Civic or other small gets today in the city."
[Deleted User],Mar-14,"It would depend a lot on the area. In low speed, heavily congested situations with very little highway use, I have learned that a hybrid is not a bad idea. Also, I have seen quite a few articles on how these small, boosted mills are falling shot of F/E promises."
dudleyr,Mar-14,Certainly the case for Ford. I think the VW turbos fair a little better in fuel economy.
[Deleted User],Mar-14,"Well, also I have a lot of respect for VW in the way they rate their engines conservatively, allowing the buyer to feel like VW exceeded their expectations. VW/AG's 2.0T engine, rated at 200 HP, was notorious for being stronger than it's advertised numbers. More like 225-240.
You know, the head of Hyundai USA just stepped down. Not only were Hyundai/Kia MPG numbers not what they were supposed to be, but also I noticed this year that the 2.4 liter mills in both the Sonata and the Optima (supposedly ""unchanged"") have been down rated to 192 HP, instead of 200. (or 198 for Sonata's with single exhaust).
How does and unchanged engine make 8 less horsepower in the same car? I feel a little pencil whipped in that department.
Lastly, saw a white Honda Accord Sport on the highway. There is no way I would spend $32,000 for a Touring V6 when the Sport model looks that good. Sorry to sound like a broken record, but this is mid-size 2.0; and that Honda is a fine looking car! At $23,500, it is probably the best deal for any car on the road today.
If I had to buy a car today it would be down to Accord Sport, Mazda6 Touring, and Optima EX (with a d*mn backup camera) as contestants."
benjaminh,Mar-14,"cski: Since it sounds like you do c. 90% city miles, maybe you should put a hybrid on your imaginary wish list. The Accord hybrid, for instance, may not have the wheels or dual exhaust you crave, but at c. 50 mpg city, compared to c. 24 for the Optima, you might save almost c. $1000 a year on gas. Plus the visibility problem would be fixed with thin pillars, Hofmeister kinks, and rear and side cameras. The problem is that the Accord hybrid is in such demand it's selling for almost msrp at this point. In another 6 months, however, prices will probably go down as production in Ohio on the hybrid ramps up. I'm thinking about a hybrid myself for whenever it comes time to replace my 2008 Accord. I'd save about a thousand a year on gas too. Of course, that never makes up for the purchase price of a new car...."
ahightower,Mar-14,"I really REALLY appreciate my Accord ('13 Sport 6MT) this week. My wife was rear-ended in it. Not severely, 10-15 mph, no injury, and little damage to the car. But still it added up to a $750 insurance estimate, and that assumes there's no damage behind the bumper panel.
I dropped it off at the body shop and went to get the rental. They set me up with a compact... Ordinarily I'd insist on something comparable size, but the adjuster and rental guy were very pleasant and moving quickly for us, and I only expected to need it a short time. So I figured why not get something small, save on gas in the meantime? It'll be parked at the airport a couple days anyway. Plus it is a 2014 Hyundai Elentra, which I admit to being slightly curious about. Is it really as good as the reviews say? It's as big as a midsizer inside, so they say... I'll take it.
Well. I know rental cars don't get treated with the most TLC, but this thing is quite a disappointment. It's the base model, apparently, or close to it. Interior materials are chintzy (and not very clean - trying not to judge the CAR for that, but it adds to the ""experience""). Seat is quite uncomfortable - too narrow. Dead pedal is too small for my size 12. Front leg room is okay with the seat all the way back, and the steering wheel tilts and telescopes. It does have a USB port, no bluetooth. Road noise is better than my '08 Mazda3, but noticeably worse than my Accord. Adjustable steering is gimmicky - Comfort is sloppy, Sport is ridiculously stiff (had a flashback to the wife's 1996 Geo Metro with no power assist) - just leave it in Normal. Brakes are fine. Back seat leg room is small with driver's seat back - not seeing the ""midsize"" interior here. Maybe it's the head room, which is quite good, and not to be discounted... but it's no replacement for an actual midsize sedan.
The worst aspect is definitely its transmission. Six-speed auto with manu-matic gate. Seems promising and impressive for the price, but it is an absolute dog. It's desperate for higher gears at the expense of power. 2K RPM at 70 mph is good, I believe the 40+ mpg highway claims. I'm being unkind to it and getting 33 in moderate traffic. But there's no power when you start from a stop, until suddenly it's racing like a maniac. Just so poorly calibrated, or something. Manumatic isn't worth the effort - it's reasonably responsive to ""manual"" shifts for what it is, but not something I want to deal with all the time. Again, perhaps this is a mistreated rental and not representative of the brand, but it's only got 4K on the clock. I feel I'd get better mpg with a transmission that kept the engine in its dang power band until I was at cruising speed, versus one that has to be stomped into submission. Or maybe I am just a stick shift control freak and this crap is considered acceptable to most people. I don't remember having any issues with the Optima I test drove last summer. The power seems adequate, if the transmission were more cooperative.
Anyway, this is getting long, and it's not a midsize car, but I thought I'd rant a bit on my coffee break. Bottom line - I really am glad I got this thing, because it's going to make my Accord feel like an M5 and I'll fall in lover all over again. I just hope the damage is minor so that it doesn't hurt me on Carfax or whatever. TTFN."
benjaminh,Mar-14,"cars.com says the Accord hybrid, like the others, fails to achieve its epa mpg estimates:
http://www.cars.com/honda/accord-hybrid/2014/expert-reviews/
""....We've tested the Fusion Hybrid extensively around our Chicago offices, and it has failed to achieve numbers even close to its EPA ratings. I tested the Accord Hybrid in Southern California over nearly 500 miles of highway, city and mountain driving, and it, too, fell far short of the posted ratings.
The Accord Hybrid achieved its best mileage in heavy, congested traffic, where the trip computer showed more than 42 mpg. For the rest of my time, it hovered right above 40 mpg. My final fill-up had the trip computer showing 40.8 mpg. My calculated mileage came out a bit higher, at 42.3 mpg.
While 42 mpg of real-world mileage is nothing to sneeze at, I was mostly driving alone or with one passenger, I never switched the air conditioning on (instead relying on 50-70 degree outside air to come through the vents), and when traversing down mountain roads I used both the EV mode and the aggressive regenerative braking mode...."""
fushigi,Mar-14,"I don't get it. How does ""Having trim lines .. lowers costs .."" lead to ""This allows them to offer a .. car .. for just a little bit more money.""? Lower manufacturing costs leads to a more expensive product? Sounds like Honda is more interested in a higher profit margin than in giving the consumer a good deal."

explorerx4,Mar-14,My Fusion 2.0 turbo with the optional 19 inch wheels has averaged 27.9 mpg for the year I have had it. It's rated at 26 mpg combined. It will improve from there.
ab348,Mar-14,"@ahightower - thanks for the impressions on the Elantra. Whenever Hyundai introduces a new model the automotive press always goes ga-ga at first and declares it the class leader, which is what happened in this case. But not long thereafter in comparisons it was not faring so well, and I have heard numerous people either expressing their dissatisfaction with their purchase, or being disappointed after a test drive and changing their purchase plans. Sounds like not a very good choice.
@cski - Hyundai has a pattern of overstating power and fuel economy ratings, which does not match up with real-world experience. Many tests of the Sonata Turbo commented to the effect that it didn't drive like it had 270HP under the hood, and I always doubted that rating. I suspect it puts out nowhere near that much power, but like Detroit in the '60s, it gives them something to advertise. I am not a fan of that company."
akirby,Mar-14,The problem with hybrids is the EPA test is at 70 degrees on summer fuel with no ethanol. When you test a hybrid on E-10 in winter temps on winter blend fuel of course it's going to get worse mpg.
explorerx4,Mar-14,It is pretty obvious that 'expert' reviewer only had half a clue about how hybrid work.
stickguy,Mar-14,"What I don't get is why people get upset with the manufacturer for not getting the MPG calculated on a totally artificial test. Blame the EPA. they designed the test parameters, the makers just design the car to take the test."
nyccarguy,Mar-14,"@stickguy
It is ridiculous & people are crazy when it comes to their car not meeting the EPA fuel economy numbers. They think they will get the EPA HIGHWAY rating driving around town. The car manufacturers play to this by advertising XxxX Car has the best in class highway fuel economy in the mid-sized segment. In real life, who is going to notice the 3 mpg difference between the top 4 cars as far as fuel economy goes in XXX Class?
The government (or the car companies) need to change their testing standards to reflect real world driving. In addition to MPG, they could use a cost per mile or cost of fuel per 100 miles."
stickguy,Mar-14,"they did change at one point. Maybe just discount the city number another 10%?
the other issue is defining ""city"". that to me is more local, as in back roads, modest speeds. Not excessive stops/starts, idling, low speeds and short hops. That is pretty much most of my wifes driving (mine too), and we never get close to the city # around town, especially on the big-engine fatso stuff (odyssey), where I expect about 3-4 MPG less. No way I was getting 20MPG in that use on the van (15-17 depending on weather was more likely). Get about the same 17ish on the RDX, but that easily can beat the highway # (I have had 200+ mile runs breaking 30 in that)."
suydam,Mar-14,"With my '13 Accord, I got the EPA numbers in Spring, Summer, and Fall. They have slipped somewhat during this very cold winter. The city number is still the same (26) but I'm not getting 36 highway, more like 32 or 33. I don't consider that bad information but just the fact of living in a cold climate with winter gas. I'm pretty happy with the mileage estimates overall."
[Deleted User],Mar-14,"The only thing I know for sure is my own numbers under heavy congestion. I barely crack 20 mpg. I live 13 miles from the Pentagon. My average speed from my last fill-up was 22 mph, and my average trip is 4.4 miles. My trip computer when I parked last night indicated 19.7 MPG on a car rated at 24/35. Not good.
In automotive news: Fiat just bought the remaining 41% of Chrysler. It now completely controls the company. (Source: Motortrend, April 2014)."
benjaminh,Mar-14,"Probably I didn't phrase it very well.
Since I'm a fan of the Accord, another way to say it would be: Honda gives you a substantially better car for just a modestly higher price. There are lots of good cars in this segment, but for some, including Consumer Reports (which just chose the Accord as its top pick in midsize), Car and Driver (which yet again has put it on their 10 Best list), and Edmunds, the current Accord is something of a benchmark:
Edmunds.com: ""The Accord is in many ways today's segment benchmark, offering a terrific blend of efficiency, driver involvement, comfort, space, refinement and equipment.""
www.edmunds.com/auto-shows/chicago/2014/2014-chicago-auto-show-2015-subaru-legacy-faq.html
When the all-new 2013 Accord was introduced, it was the only best-selling midsize sedan to earn a ""Good"" on the IIHS small-offset crash test. The Camry was rated ""Poor""--which was essentially a failing grade. It wasn't just chance that made that happen. Honda spent hundreds of millions of dollars in engineering and on super high strength steel to achieve that result with its ACEII structure. Quoting from Honda:
""The 2013 Accord unit-body uses 55.8-percent high-tensile steel, more than in any previous Accord. In addition, 17.2-percent of the steel is now grade 780, 980 and 1,500 – extremely high grades that have never before been used in any Accord.""
http://automobiles.honda.com/news/press-releases-article.aspx?Article=6825-en
This is part of what made the Accord not just safer than a Camry, but safer than a BMW, Audi, or Mercedes. Again, that costs a lot of money.
Camry quickly played catch-up, and added more steel to the 2014.5 Camry, which is now rated ""Acceptable"" in the IIHS crash test. That's better than failing, but still below the Accord.
Compared to the Camry LE, which has an essentially identical list price to the Accord LX, the Accord has a more advanced engine, gets higher mpg, has higher safety ratings, has more features (like dual zone climate control standard), etc.
In other words, Honda is trying with this generation to move the Accord a bit upmarket.
If you want to the lowest price, there are all sorts of good choices—Altima, Camry, Sonata, etc.
If you want something a little better than those in most areas, you have to pay somewhat more for the Accord. It's still a good ""value,"" and has a competitive price, but Honda can't as easily put as much in the way incentives on the Accord, because it probably costs them c.$2000 more to make the Accord compared to some of their competitors. It's one of those ""you get what you pay for"" situations imo.
It still remains to be seen whether Honda can completely succeed with this strategy, but they've tried to make the Accord the benchmark with this generation. The LX model in particular, which was a more basic car in the last generation, has had essentially thousands of dollars of improvements and equipment added, but the list price went up only a few hundred dollars.
And, as CSKI and others have said, the Accord Sport, with its premium wheels and tires, power seat, dual exhaust, etc., is one of the best deals in midsize with an msrp starting at $23,715. And you can get get good discounts and financing on that. But you are not currently going to get $5000 off of list, as you can on a few models of Sonata and Altima at my local dealers.
That's a very lengthy way to try to answer the question from the point of view of a fan and owner of the Accord.
Sorry it's so long!"
akirby,Mar-14,4 miles is barely long enough for the engine to warm up. In heavy traffic to boot you're lucky to get 19 mpg.
benjaminh,Mar-14,"Truth about Cars reviews the Accord Hybrid. The reviewer Alex Dykes has a very detailed review, including 20+ minute video. In an 800+ mi mpg test, he did get the epa rating of 47 mpg. This has just now become my dream car to replace my 2008 Accord someday. But since I still have almost 2 more years of the HondaCare warranty on my current ride, I think I'll probably wait till the end of 2015.

""...In many ways the Accord Hybrid shares more design themes with the Fisker Karma than a Toyota Prius....Honda went back to the drawing board and designed a true serial hybrid....
The Accord Hybrid’s impressive 50/45/47 MPG EPA rating (City/Highway/Combined) is even more impressive when you look at some of Honda’s design choices. First off all hybrid trims get tires one size wider (225/50R17 vs 215/55R17) than the gas-only Accord to compensate for the 230 lb weight increase. Secondly Honda chose to trickle-down Acura’s two-mode damper technology into the Accord. These two choices define how the car feels out on the road with the Accord barely nudging the Fusion out of first place when it comes to overall on-road performance....
....the Accord’s large greenhouse and low beltline give it the best visibility in the segment....
With all the numbers tallied the Accord Hybrid is an easy winner. It is more expensive than the competition but that delta shrinks when you account for feature content. The delta becomes immaterial however when you look at our average fuel economy numbers of 47.8 MPG in the Accord and 30 to mid-30s in all of the competition (including that 47 MPG Fusion.) Honda’s hybrid has the best road manners in the pack, the most composed ride, a comfy back seat and a quiet cabin....
Specifications as tested:
0-30: 2.8 Seconds
0-60: 7.0 Seconds
Cabin noise at 50 MPH: 69 db
Average Observed Fuel Economy: 47.8 MPG over 835 miles."
ivan_99,Mar-14,"EPA mileage.
You're not supposed to get the EPA's numbers. They are just a guesstimate on what you may achieve.
Last I recall...they don't even test drive them or measure how much fuel is used. They put it on a dyno and measure the exhaust gas to calculate how much fuel is used (they say it is more accurate) during the simulation.
The numbers are only supposed to be used to compare to other automobiles.
So if vehicle-A achieves 20 mpg and vehicle-B achieves 22 mpg for the same test you can only assume if you purchased vehicle-B over vehicle-A that you'd achieve a little better mileage...not that you'd achieve 22 mpg.
Style...I find driving style affects my mileage more than anything else. I tend to like torque...and slowly accelerating away from a light in a peaky engine doesn't work for me (like the Elantra engine). I stomp it and the little motor revs and screams like it's on fire. I do better (mileage) in a larger engine (or diesel) that has more torque running it at 30% versus a peaky engine at 90%"
akirby,Mar-14,They actually measure the burned hydrocarbons from the exhaust which is far more accurate about how much fuel is being combusted. Each gallon of fuel produces a specific amount of exhaust waste.
[Deleted User],Mar-14,"It doers have great MPG.. The Accord Hybrid pictured looks like an LX. .
It is certainly the most complicated hybrid drive system on the mid size market, as it really has no transmission to speak of (which might make some people happy who had Honda tranny problems in the past). It is just not for me.
Maybe when I am in the market for a new car the high-mpg choices will be more attractive to me."
ivan_99,Mar-14,"Yeah...that's what they say
I just have a hard time believing that a real...real accurate measuring cup (my terminology for an industrial...or medical...fluid measuring device) wouldn't give you a more accurate amount of fuel burnt than looking at exhaust gases.
I suppose they're the scientists...so I skeptically nod in agreement..."
[Deleted User],Mar-14,"...or they were delirious from exhaust gasses when they jotted down those numbers....."" dude whatever it gets 30 something, right?"" (slumps to the floor)"
explorerx4,Mar-14,"@cski
How does your mileage with the Optima compare to the Jeep you had before it?
I kind on think you have to look at the proportion."
akirby,Mar-14,They actually collect the carbon in the exhaust and weigh it - each gallon of gas produces a specific amount of carbon when it burns. Liquid measurements are simply not accurate enough.
m6user,Mar-14,Somehow I think they may know how to measure fuel consumption better than using a coffee cup and a calculator. I believe it was scientists that had to calculate the amount of fuel needed to get to the moon and back and that was 45 years ago so I think they can measure gas used by an automobile.
[Deleted User],Mar-14,"The Jeep gave me about 15 mpg with the 4.7 liter V8, and the 5 speed automatic and Selec-Trac II 4x4. I loved it. The whole vehicle just drove fantastic, even at 12 years old. But that was the problem. It was 12 years old and it was expensive to maintain, and even with the snow this year I didn't need 4 wheel drive. If I lived out by Winchester VA or Frederick MD I would have bought another 4x4."
ivan_99,Mar-14,"Yup, but if they measured the amount of fuel they'd need to go to the moon by measuring the exhaust gas of the rocket sitting on a rocket sled I'd still be skeptical; and probably worried if I was taking the trip.
I'm certain Bill Nye the science guy could explain it so I could understand. Though, regardless of the measuring scheme used, the EPA numbers are just supposed to be used in comparison to other automobiles."
m6user,Mar-14,"I'll agree that the numbers are best used for comparison. However, they are still supposed to be a realistic range for the ""average"" driver.....if there is one. I have an AWD 2013 RDX that is rated at 22mpg combined. My mpg since buying the vehicle 18 months ago is sitting at 24.2 mpg. That is mostly suburban Chicago area driving with maybe about 20% freeway driving. I've been able to get very close or better than EPA on every vehicle I've had for about the past 10 years and especially since the EPA revised their numbers to make them more realistic in 2008 I think it was. I don't race people at stoplights often but I'm hardly what one might call a sedate driver."
akirby,Mar-14,"All things being equal, your fuel economy results relative to the EPA ratings should be fairly consistent. If you used to get 2 mpg better than EPA combined then you can reasonably expect the same on a new vehicle. However....... all things are no longer equal. Hybrids and small displacement direct injection turbos are much more sensitive to driving parameters and E-10 fuel and even temperature so the more you get away from the exact EPA test parameters the harder it is to get EPA results. New stricter emissions also have a negative effect especially on short drives.
EPA testing wasn't designed for buyers - they're done primarily for CAFE compliance and they have to be modified with a formula to come up with the window sticker ratings. I've often said they should publish a range instead of just 3 numbers, but the resulting range would be so big that it wouldn't be useful at all (15 - 34 mpg e.g.)."
[Deleted User],Mar-14,"So basically, if my car isn't sitting in a warehouse at 72 F running at 1700 RPM at a simulated 60 MPH then I will get 19 mpg instead of 40, and that is perfectly OK. No really, I get it. It isn't the manufacturers fault that I have ten stoplights to get one mile to the grocery store, all crammed with cars. I really will look into a hybrid next time. All I was thinking was that the car looks and drives great, and it should be good on gas. And it is. Just not as good as I expected."

He saw my car when I was leaving work, wasn't sure if it was me, thought the car looked great, and wasn't sure what it was.
They are looking for an AWD sedan and the Fusion is on the list."

explorerx4,Mar-14,He doesn't like CVT's.
plekto,Mar-14,"There is no substitute for mass.
Simply put, the problem with these high-revving gutless engines is that they have no torque. 250+ HP at 7000 rpm does no good if you're at 1500 rpm at a stoplight trying to get somewhere."
backy,Mar-14,"The 200 has a 9-speed honest-to-goodness automatic, not a CVT. And it's gorgeous--just saw it today."
backy,Mar-14,"Saw the new 200 at the Greater Twin Cities Auto Show today. Unfortunately, it wasn't available for sitting in, but at least the doors were open so I got a good look inside. Really a sharp-looking car, if somewhat generic ""modern mid-sized sedan"" in profile. But if the reception it got at the show is any indication, Chrysler will have some trouble building interest in this car. While I was there, a beautiful blonde in a sleek black dress was standing beside the car, doing her pitch with a mic. The auto show was packed... so packed that even the Mitsubishi display was busy! Tons of people. I was the only person paying any attention to her presentation. I was focusing on the car... of course. Afterwards, I told her it was too bad I was the only one listening because she did a good job. She told me the 200 would go on sale next month.
Not much else real new in the mid-sized class, but I sat in an Accord Sport with AT (every mid-sizer I sat in had a slushbox); wish Honda had paid the extra bucks to run power to the car (as several other makes did) so I could adjust the power seat. Nice car for $25k. Too many like-sized small buttons, but most mid-sizers suffer from that these days (Fusion Hybrid was the worst on that score). Sat in a Camry XLE Hybrid, and thought to myself that Toyota should be embarrassed at the interior design vs. some competitors at the same price. No new Sonata or Legacy on display, but not too surprised at that--Twin Cities show doesn't get debuts.
Frankly, the most impressive cars I saw were small cars: the new Fit (couldn't sit in it, but looks like a huge improvement), the new Golf (interior quality is Audi-esque, looks good outside also and base engine is the 1.8T), the Mazda3, and the Forte (the sedan, hatch, and Koup were all sharp cars). The Fiat 500 was pretty nice too, although trying too hard to be cute. And a little up the scale, the Audi A3 (couldn't sit in that one either), BMW 2 Series, and (surprisingly to me) the ATS. Of course also lots of great cars I can only dream about... Corvette StingRay, Jaguar F-Type, Porsche Cayman to name 3."
stickguy,Mar-14,"the A3 was open in philly. It was nice. but gets quite pricey with a few options.
I agree about the Golf. very impressive. as is the mazda 3. not midsize of course (well, not these days). those 2 would be my short list right now if I needed to buy a new car (and wanted new) in the fall."
stickguy,Mar-14,"Oh, I agree about the 200. it was up on a turntable with the doors open. From what I could see from the distance, a vast improvement over the current model. Will definitely stop at the dealer (though I hate our local Chrysler/Dodge store) to scope one out in person."
ahightower,Mar-14,"These are not mutually exclusive. Just because a company profits from a very good product doesn't mean it's not also a good value for the buyer. In fact, it seems the worst products are often those which tend to offer the best ""deals""... If by ""deal"" you mean lower price of entry and ignore quality, reliability, maintenance, and resale."
ahightower,Mar-14,"I suspect that poor mpg has more to do with the short trip than the temp or the traffic. It just hasn't much time to warm up. At any rate, with a commute that short, I envy you, and probably would have just gotten a pickup!"
akirby,Mar-14,Engines today have to run rich at higher RPM when cold to kickstart the emissions systems. If you only drive a few miles at a time your mileage will be terrible - even worse with a hybrid.

I would get the A3/Golf GTI in a heartbeat if I was smaller and had no kids. I have always wanted an A6 as well.

fushigi,Mar-14,"My comment was in reply to benjaminh's words on Honda, which were basically that offering fewer options leads to reduced manufacturing costs which in turn leads to higher consumer prices. IDK why benjaminh followed that up with another Accord review instead of addressing my issue (lower costs leading to higher prices).
Whether Honda's are a good value or not is beside the point."
suydam,Mar-14,"What he meant was that fewer variations and thus lower production costs allow Honda to put features as standard that are usually found on more expensive cars, like a backup camera and better quality components. That doesn't mean the cars cost less, but that they have more content relative to price."
dudleyr,Mar-14,"We also have just a little bit of fluctuation in SD. It was 70 here on Sunday and the previous weekend the high was -6. Strangely exactly one year prior to the day that was -6 for the high we had a record high of 80. Same day, 86 degree difference in highs.

[Deleted User],Mar-14,"Man Dudley, 86 degree temp difference IS a big swing in 24 hours.
To imidazol97, when I am not using it I put it in the basement storage room., after shaking (or washing) it off. Actually, washing it off quickly is a good idea. That way pollen will not build up on the outside. Mind you, I am not using it daily year round, Just when I really don't want a pollenmobile. After June the pollen is done."
[Deleted User],Mar-14,"I had a chance to chat up my neighbor who just bought a Mazda 3 (2.5 liter GT with 18"" wheels). It has an amazing quality interior for a compact car. I can see that they are going to sell a lot of them. It has an I-drive type setup, just like the Mazda6, and very similar to BMW. (which actually is called I-Drive).
I am willing to bet that if someone was blindfolded and placed in the drivers seat, he or she would have a very hard time distinguishing it as a compact, or anything costing less than $30,000. He said he paid $27k, including everything."
backy,Mar-14,"But if someone were blindfolded and sat in the back seat, they'd have NO trouble telling the Mazda3 is a compact!
I went back to the auto show today, one day wasn't enough. I was by myself this time so I could spend as much time as I wanted on a car. One of my missions was to come up with a short list for my next car, and my wife's next vehicle (she doesn't like shopping for cars, delegates that to me with veto power).
Somewhat to my surprise, there isn't a single mid-sized sedan (by traditional definition) on either list. Not so much a surprise for me, as I prefer small cars, especially hatchbacks, so my list has 4 small hatchbacks on it. But my wife has driven several mid-sizers and has a Sonata now. I am thinking for her next vehicle, it should either be a small SUV like the Forester, CR-V, or CX-5 (for ease of entry/exit and versatility as well as AWD) or a small, somewhat tall compact sedan with mid-sized interior room, e.g. Corolla or Sentra. Or a small but tall hatch like the Soul. I was really impressed by the rear-seat leg room in those small cars--more than in some mid-sized sedans. Decent-sized trunks also. And they'd be easier to park. And less expensive to buy. Although some mid-sizers can be had for a great discount these days. Case in point: saw a sign-and-drive 3-year lease on a 2014 Sonata GLS in my local paper today for $199/month. I think that's about the lowest sign-and-drive 3-year lease I've seen advertised in recent memory on a mid-sized car."

I didn't even look in the backy! Seriously though, I did read a compact comparo in Motortrend that picked the Jetta as the back seat space winner. (the TDI won the comparo )
BTW, on the next car for your wife topic, I think the CX-5 won quite a few comparo' s. I think it looks great too, and the 2.0 liter is good on gas, although a bit small for a CUV. The 2.5 would be perfect."
backy,Mar-14,"Yeah, the Jetta has a very roomy back seat and trunk also, it's just kinda pricey. For the same price as a decently-equipped Jetta I could get a Forester 2.5i, which I think would work a lot better for my wife. The CX-5 looks great but I'm concerned about review comments re firm ride and road noise. Thus I think the Forester or CR-V would be a better fit for her. She doesn't care about crisp handling or lots of power. Which is why I'm thinking a small sedan or hatch (e.g. Soul) with a roomy interior might work just fine for her.
But maybe when it's time to turn in her Sonata off lease late next year, the Hyundai dealer will offer us an incredible year-end closeout deal on the all-new 2015 Sonata, which looks quite sharp from pics I've seen, and we'll jump on it. Too early to tell; so many good choices out there. I've had short lists in the past that I've tossed out the window because of a specific opportunity, e.g. the 2005 Mazda6i hatch I got this summer wasn't on my short list at the time, but I've always loved that design and when I found a great deal on a sample in great condition, I jumped on it."
[Deleted User],Mar-14,"To backy: The Soul has good reviews. It recently beat the Fit 500L in a head to head comparo. They recommended the 2.0 liter engine with 160 HP vs. the 1.6 with 130hp for the size of the vehicle. (C/D February 2014 issue, page 39)
Believe it or not that Jetta TDI (value edition) cost $23,850. That was price AS TESTED. Not just the base price. That includes heated seats, alloys, and a six speed manual, but the 7 speed auto is a $900 option. (December 2013 issue page 71).
Lastly, the Subaru Forester was the Motortrend SUV of the year. There is a big 12 SUV comparo, also in the December 2013 issue, page 88. They liked both the base 170 HP model and the 250 HP turbo XT. $24,320/$28,820."

ahightower,Mar-14,"I'm considering a job change that will double my commute distance to 80 miles round trip daily. So, have given some thought to whether the beloved 2013 Accord Sport 6MT is still ideal for that situation. The fuel savings of a hybrid or diesel won't make up for a higher car payment. At $3.50/gal, staying at the same 28 mpg will only cost me about $100 a month more in fuel. I'd need 56 mpg to break even on fuel cost, and even more to actually subsidize a higher car payment. (The increased pay, BTW, more than makes up for fuel, maintenance, increased frequency of replacement vehicles... my real dillema is whether I'm willing to give up so many hours of my life commuting, but that's a somewhat different topic). But regarding vehicles, if I'm to spend so much time in the car, and not the fun type of driving, I might appreciate a higher end stereo and some additional luxury features (air conditioned butt sounds nice!). Specifically, some sort of radar/laser cruise control to make the bumper-to-bumper less irritating. At the same time, I'd hate to pile so many miles on a very expensive car. A high mileage Accord will still be easy to sell in 5 years, and hopefully will be perfectly reliable until then. It still feels very luxurious compared to my last car, and I really don't mind a manual transmission this good in traffic. I'll probably stick with what I have until there is a pure electric with over 100 miles of range and lots of leg room in my price range."
m6user,Mar-14,"@ahightower
Congrats on new job. The Mazda6 may be a possibility. Good auto tranny, driving dynamics that are as good or better than the Accord, great gas mileage with RUG.

But again, the cost/benefit doesn't quite work out to make a change at this time. My inner cheapskate (who I had to stifle just to end up with a new Sport in the first place) says, pay it off and drive it into the ground.

It's far enough that I'd consider moving across town, but the family is all plugged in with friends and church and kids activities on our side of town. So Dad will suck it up and commute until the nest is empty and we can downsize closer to the office."
Kirstie_H,Mar-14,"While you've still got your mental faculties intact, I'll say I think your current plan to keep your vehicle is a good one. In fact, since you might be getting a bump in pay, my not-so-inner cheapskate would suggest paying it off more quickly. If you can, you could find yourself in a situation with NO car payment for awhile, save a few extra $$, and then reward yourself with something pretty. Even accelerating a bit can get you into a positive equity position pretty quickly, which makes it easier to trade in.
Trading to save on gas is usually a losing proposition, which you know. It's psychologically easier to eat a higher car payment, though. You pay the car payment once a month, most of us on auto-pay, and you don't think about it again. But you think about gas costs every time you have to fill up."
explorerx4,Mar-14,"@ahightower
Your fuel mileage will probably edge up towards the rated highway MPG with your longer commute.
Make sure you like the job before you lock yourself into a new car based on a longer commute."
ahightower,Mar-14,"@Kirstie@Edmunds - Agreed. I like our other car more every month that I don't make a payment. 2005 Yukon, 113K. It was a big payment for us at the time, but we really liked it, and we intended it to see us through raising our three boys. So far, so good, and not even halfway through with it, I hope. It's another case of mpg being irrelevant. It's no fun buying gas $100 bucks/30 gallons at a time... but that only happens once a month. (My wife plans to trade it for a new Mini when the stinky teenagers depart.)
It occurs to me that my oldest will be driving in 3-5 years (the range depends entirely upon his maturity...) If I put 22K a year on the Accord, it'll still be a perfect first car for the kids.
@explorerx4 - I do hope my mpg increases on the long commute. I've used the Fuelly app since I bought the car. Without doing much to avoid traffic, and almost never using the econ button, I'm doing 28.7.
http://www.fuelly.com/driver/ahightower/accord
It's rated 34 highway, so I expect I can consistently break 30 if I time traffic well and calm down my driving style. The drive home may be tougher to avoid traffic... I'd have toll and non-toll options, and I may determine the slightly longer but freer flowing toll route is worth the fuel and sanity savings on the PM drive."
[Deleted User],Mar-14,"I think The Accord (Sport) is exactly the right weapon to attack an 80 mile round trip commute, as long as it is mostly clutch-in driving. It is well built, frugal, and reliable as a refrigerator
However, if I had to pump that clutch for 1.5 hours each way... then well, not so much."
dudleyr,Mar-14,"I will add that I think you will be surprised by better mpg even if you don't change your driving habits as the car will be spending much more time warmed up, which is much more efficient than a cold engine. Tweek speeds down a bit and avoid heavy throttle and you will be mid thirties before you know it.
Post back on how your mpg improves on the new commute."
benjaminh,Mar-14,"Warm engine really helps my mpg. And keeping the speed to c.64-68 instead of 70-74 adds about 2-3 mpg as well. I've got the Accord CVT, and that adds another 2-3, which is how I was once able to get as high as 40 on a highway trip (plus the ac was off)...."
benjaminh,Mar-14,"Automobile magazine compares the Chrysler 200 and the Accord:
""Chrysler has gone for a cockpit-like treatment with a high center console that angles up to meet the dash.....Unfortunately, the enveloping feel applies not just to the driver but to the passengers as well. Rear-seat space is adequate for a six-footer, but the 200 closes in around you due to its sloping roofline, rising beltline, and thick pillars.
What a contrast to the Accord....Honda's longtime talent for space efficiency is on display here. Sit in the rear seat, and not only are the front seatbacks far away from your knees, but a six-footer's head doesn't brush the roof and you can easily see outside. The squared-off cabin is as airy as a downtown loft. The windows are large, the pillars are thin, the console is low -- it's a formula that today's auto designers have largely discarded, but one that is absolutely endearing for a car's driver and passengers.""

1) I wish the rear seats would fold completely flat. The seatbacks stick up at an angle when folded, as they do on most sedans. I wish more automakers would copy the clever design of the Mazda6 hatch, in which the rear seat bottom moves down as you fold the seatback, resulting in a flat cargo floor.

brian125,Mar-14,"Move the parking brake out of the bottom center Console and onto the floor. I find this to be a very bad place for a barking brake handle.................... What was Honda Thinking? By the way speaking about the Accords terrible sound system. The radio is a Alpine, and the speakers are Fosters.. If you upgrade the speakers it will be a big improvement.
By far one of the worst Radio, Speaker combo in any vehicle I have had and heard. Put this system in the basic model Civic.
I had a 2003 Honda pilot and the sound system was alot better than what they have been putting in the Accords. Ford, mazda, Nissan and Kia 's radio's are much better than my Accords radio.
My Bmw X-5 has a very good sound system with 16 speakers. My Genesis R-Spec has a Lexicon 17 speaker, 7.1 surround sound with a built in amp... by far this system is up there with the best sound systems you could get in a vehicle. Top dogs in this field that I have had are.... Bang & olufsen, Mark levinson, Bowers & Wilkins, Harmon kardon, Boston acostic's, and I like some Bose systems. I'd love to see one of these systems in the Accord.. Even the lower end Bose system would be such a big improvement.

backy,Mar-14,"Maybe on a low-end car, that could be a problem. But mid-sized sedans come pretty well equipped these days, even in base form. So a little over $17k for a base Fusion or base Sonata is a great deal on a nice car, IMO. In the case of the Sonata, we're talking a car with nearly 200 hp, power windows/locks/mirrors, 6-speaker audio with XM radio, and 16"" wheels. Not a penalty box by any means. Not the best in class, but in my experience a highly competent family sedan. The lease is even a better deal... $189/month for 3 years is close to the depreciation on the car!
And in MN, the ads have to say whether there's just one or a few stock numbers at the advertised price. Sometimes I see ads like that. The ads I saw yesterday weren't like that."
suydam,Mar-14,"I don't find the Accord sound that terrible, just not as good as the Altima's. The XM sounds great. I like the parking brake in the middle. And overall I really love the car. I have had it for a year now."
[Deleted User],Mar-14,"brian125: I remember installing aftermarket stereos in the mid-nineties Accords and it was really, really simple. Head unit was double din, and the speakers were all 6 1/2"". I don't understand why many Asian cars now use rear door speakers instead of the rear deck. My car has them in the rear doors, and they unequivocally suck. There is a round area, but not cutout, where the OEM 8"" sub would be if I had opted for the Infinity stereo.
I have a 1 cubic foot Infinity powered sub that I added on, but with only 200w RMS it barely gets through to my ears. Since there are no cutouts for speakers in the deck, that space and bass reflex properties of the trunk are completely wasted.
Is the stereo any good in the base Optima EX? Yes and no. Digital media sounds fine (MP3, CD, SAT). The FM stereo is dreadful. It sounds like AM.
Backy: On the ""teaser deals"", I am sure there are some actual deals out there at the advertised price. I was just being silly, but there is truth in the silliness, and like you said, it depends on the car, and on whether the dealer can get away with bait and switch, which is illegal in VA."
dudleyr,Mar-14,"Please keep the emergency brake where it is. Foot parking brakes are worthless. They can't be modulated properly as they lock up as they are pressed and the only release all at once.
One more area where control is taken away from the driver. No thank you!"
akirby,Mar-14,When do you NEED to modulate the parking brake? You don't need to do that for parking and in an emergency you can just use full braking anyway. They weren't designed to help you drift around a turn or slide on ice.
Mr_Shiftright,Mar-14,I think he means in situations where you might be driving a manual trans car and have to start back up after stopping on an uphill.
[Deleted User],Mar-14,"1) I haven't used my parking brake since I bought my (automatic) car.
2) Sliding and drifting is fun."
dudleyr,Mar-14,"Exactly. I don't need it, but it is nice to have and my kids do occasionally need it. The Accord does have a hill holder clutch, but it only engages for a couple of seconds which may not be enough for a beginner. I still have a 14 year old that I need to keep from the dark side (by teaching him the jedi art of shifting for himself).
And yes drifting is fun in the winter. I live on a narrow street and in the winter I can just spin right into my parking spot."
ahightower,Mar-14,"Short answer: The HANDbrake belongs at HAND
The hill-holder feature is very cool, and I'm surprised at how much I've appreciated it. It's probably prolonging the life of the clutch as well. But yes, there are times that you want to use the hand brake for longer stops. Like, parked in neutral with the engine running.
cski - It's best to use the e-brake even with an automatic. For one, it relieves some of the force being exerted on the gears/transmission. You know that feeling of putting it in park and then it slumping forward or backward a few inches? That ain't good for it. And it could make it hard to get back out of Park later. Also, if you rarely use it, and then decide you need it one day and the cable hasn't moved in a very long time, it could get stuck or broken. This is why on certain new luxury cars, the parking brake is electronic and can be set to automatically engage every time you go into Park. Lexus, and others presumably, know that it is best practice to use the parking brake when parking (engage it before letting your foot of the brake)."
[Deleted User],Mar-14,"ahightower: It is like out of sight, out of mind. My parking brake is on the floor, and until we started talking about it, I have not even thought about it, nor have I felt the lever with my foot. It is like it doesn't exist.
About it being fun to slide: I have not had any fun sliding the Optima, but I sure did when I was younger. A lot younger. On cheaper cars, and when there were a lot less people to put in danger.

m6user,Apr-14,"The 2.4L in the 2014 Optima is rated on the KIA website at 192hp. I thought the original hp rating was 198 and then it was revised. But I do recall that one version of either the Sonata or Optima, maybe the SE, was rated at a couple of extra HP or 200. I would check the fine print with your insurer. If their own rule is ""over 200hp"", then 200hp shouldn't trigger the surcharge. Too many insurance companies out there to be playing those kind of games IMO."

ab348,Apr-14,The answer: Buick Regal GS.
[Deleted User],Apr-14,"If you are considering Audi, they are some of the most satisfying drivers cars on earth. I read all the magazines, and the Audi's are winning 95% of the comparos. Usually against BMW. It used to be the other way around. I would look at the A3,A4,A5, and also the Q5 if you decide a CUV is the answer.
If you decide to stay at $35,000, BMW makes a less well known 328X1. It is a small CUV, but has the 240 HP turbo 4, and will fit all your stuff too. The new Mercedes CLA class is a nice little car too, also around $35,000.
On the other end of the spectrum, the Accord and the Mazda 6 are great driving cars, but you are used to a 274 hp turbo 4, so the Mazda will not be quick in comparison. Accord and Passat have great V6 engines. Tough choices. Thanks for posting!"
[Deleted User],Apr-14,"The original 2011 Sonata with single exhaust had 198hp. Adding dual exhaust added 2hp for a total of 200.

Kia very quietly reduced the HP rating on the 2014 2.4 liter to 192, and the torque at 181. ALSO, the MPG is now 23/34, but on my sticker was 24/35.
I believe I have found the answer! Just 5 seconds ago I re-read the specs on the 2012 and found this under ""Powertrains and Performance"" from the Edmunds 2012 review URL above:
""In California-emissions states, the Optima has a Super Ultra Low Emissions rating (versus Ultra-Low elsewhere) resulting in a lower power output of 192 hp and 181 lb-ft.""
So either they post the SULEV specs from California Optima's, or Kia just builds all of them to SULEV specs starting in 2014."
dash5,Apr-14,The Buick was my runner up in 2011. Definitely warrants a test drive yes. Good point.
dash5,Apr-14,"All definitely on my list, including the Q5. I personally prefer Audi over the BMW's. I love the Audi interiors and while I'm sure BMW's are great drivers cars, for the driving I do it really wouldn't be on display. I have a 12 mile round trip commute on back roads. All my zooming is on the highway on weekends, accelerating in a straight line after going through an EZPass lane. BMW interiors are kinda blah to my eye, too.
Speaking of interiors, I love the Lexus IS350 interior. Too bad the exterior kinda kills it for me. It's the reverse for the Cadillac ATS, great exterior, not feeling the inside. Maybe I'm too picky
The 2015 Mercedes C-Class looks like it might be a real winner, but now we're getting north of 50k which is hard to justify.
So all in all, I am going to wait to see how the Acura TLX shakes out. Test drive a Regal. An A3. And sit in a fully loaded Accord V6. See what I think.

benjaminh,Apr-14,"The warmer weather really is helping sales too. If you take the c. 42,000 Camrys sold last month and multiply by 12, that's annual sales rate of slightly more than 500,000 cars, which is about how many Toyota can build in a year. Even Honda was selling at an annual rate of 407,000, which is about their capacity too. But for months during the winter everyone sold below capacity, and so a big backlog has been built up...."
ahightower,Apr-14,"Glad to see TMV for the Accord has not gone down since the incentives have added up in the market generally. About $150 below invoice, which is where I bought mine last summer. One reason I went with the ""obvious"" choice, although it was less adventurous/beautiful than the Mazda6, and less of a screaming bargain than an Optima, it's proven a safe bet in terms of holding its value. (Although I thought historically Hondas sold pretty much at or near sticker. But at least new buyers aren't getting any better a deal than I did... And prices may yet return closer to MSRP as the traffic picks up.)"
plekto,Apr-14,"The Accord is fairly bland. It's nice, but it's also a lot like a Toyota car these days in that it's OK but there's nothing really special about it, either. Appliance on wheels, basically.
Between the European sedans, (C, A4, 3), they are all nearly identical other than a (small) bias towards luxury or performance. The C class is a bit softer and more luxurious, the 3 series is more sporty and agile, and the A4 is right in the middle. The only downside with the A4 (my dad has one now) is that it is extremely understated like Lexus.
That said, all three drive or offer something better than the domestics or Japanese cars.
The Acura, Infiniti, and Lexus all were nice. Very nice. But they also were like jellybean clones of each other. You honestly can't tell what it is from a block away. I'd honestly rather just buy a (non hybrid) Fusion and save $20K if it's all going to be the same appliance.
The SUVs, my dad and I looked at them all and nothing made our hearts move even a millimeter. They've devolved into basically custom vans that are raised a few inches. Gone are the days where you could see the 4x4 truck in their DNA.

Less importantly....
Splurged on real Seibon carbon fiber parts. I have never actually touched a real piece until now. Weighs nothing, nice gloss finish and the pattern lines up well. Interesting.

berri,Apr-14,"Having owned both Honda and Toyota, I think they are different driving/riding too. I liken a Honda more toward a Ford and a Toyota more toward a GM. Nothing wrong with either, just a little difference. Having said that, where Toyota seems to get in trouble in this arena is when they try to make their vehicle sportier by tightening the suspension. It usually just turns out to be the worst of both in those situations - stiff, but not really a good driver. Most Toyota's on an Interstate are similar to a Buick; smooth and pretty quiet.

stickguy,Apr-14,"I don't know how anyone can drive an IS with AWD (as they all are, at least up north!). That massive hump in the floor to clear the AWD gear makes me contort my leg to reach the gas pedal. Very uncomfortable. And just too damned cramped overall."
benjaminh,Apr-14,"It won't surprise anyone to hear I recommend the Honda Accord. It costs a little more than Camry, Altima, etc., but I really do think Honda has higher quality engineering.
It does, in any case, top all other midsize cars at this point on the IIHS small offset crash test.
I also has hands down the best visibility of any midsize car. If I were buying a car for one of my kids that would be a big consideration right there...."
plekto,Apr-14,"For a beginning driver, you want something that's smaller, safe, slow (but not unreasonably so), and decently tough and reliable. The problem is that that means something like an old Buick which nobody wants, let alone a kid. The optimal car used to be a Volvo 240 years ago as it had good reliability, good crash scores, was slow, and had good driving characteristics and visibility.
But they are now all 20+ years old.
The problem with an Accord or Camry and most never cars is that they are too large and powerful. And they tend to have tons of things to distract a brand new driver like GPS and so on.
Now, I'm in the same boat myself. My son will be driving in about a year and I have a tough time coming up with answers. Even my basic Mustang has a touchy clutch, 305HP, and takes about 80% of your concentration to not wrap around a tree when it's raining. It's a beautiful car to drive, but it's a fantastic second or third car. Not a first one. No way my son can handle this thing starting out. And that's the big problem with cars now. They are all almost beyond the average new driver's ability to deal with and control. And getting worse as the auto makers try to out-do each other with more and more HP and speed.
So far, I have two that might work, but they're not exactly what I want, either.
1: A late 90s (98 or 99) BMW 318ti.(E36) Inexpensive, reliable enough, and with not much HP, it's a fun car (especially with manual) that won't get you into big trouble without a lot of warning and time to hopefully fix things. 140HP, 0-60 in about 9 seconds, and a 130mph top speed is exactly in the sweet spot for a new driver. The driving position and dynamics also are awesome so it takes a lot less work to drive than a typical sedan. Good looks, too, especially if it's a darker color.
2: A early 2000s (2001-2004) Toyota Tacoma with a 4 cylinder engine and 4WD. This is a slow tank and is basically indestructible since the 4WD versions weigh a bit over 500lbs lbs more than the 2WD delivery vehicle models. 4WD and the ability to haul loads even in bad weather or snow is a big plus. 140HP and a 0-60 time of about 9 seconds is also right where a new driver needs to be at, IMO."
m6user,Apr-14,"Since the OP specifically sought out opinions from people that frequent midsize sedans I'm going to assume they have put some thought into it and narrowed it down to that kind of vehicle. And since the topic is midsize sedans I'll also stick to them as I personally think a small 4X4 pickup would be an absolute terrible choice for a new driver. High center of gravity and a false sense of security that having 4 wheel drive may impart.

A used, 4-5 year old Japanese 4cyl sedan would make a very good first car. Relatively up to date safety systems, the same with crash worthiness, good repair records, low maintenence and not flashy enough to attract too much attention from all interested parties which includes the opposite sex and law enforcement officials."
suydam,Apr-14,Could not agree more.
Mr_Shiftright,Apr-14,"I like the Altima S suggestion. That's really an easy car to drive with good visibility, rational controls, very good MPG, and it's fairly decent looking, too. I'm gonna put my two cents in and nix any out-of-warranty German car."
stickguy,Apr-14,"well, not specified was new or used. For used, a 2 gen back accord (2003-2007) is an excellent choice. Reliable, easy to drive, manageable size, safe without all the distracting new tech. And if you want a stick, you can get one that is about the easiest manual ever to learn on."
[Deleted User],Apr-14,"I agree too. The Corolla and Civic are good reliable starter cars. For both sexes. Young men will find all kinds of ""MODZ"" for either car and they are well built, safe, and relatively slow.
Also, back in my day, I was happy with whatever car my parents bestowed on me. What I wanted was freedom.... (and girls)."
plekto,Apr-14,"My comment was more about how I literally have virtually nothing that I can think of that's not an absolute econobox/deathtrap or that has way too much power.
I could get him a couple of year old Accord, but that means going back to almost ten years ago to find anything that fits the criteria for a new driver. Almost all entry-level cars that are of that age are falling apart. A Civic may be nice, but a ten year old Civic is... old. The field narrows considerably when you factor in manual transmission, which I believe is an absolute must to still teach to new drivers. Unless they only plan on staying in the U.S. for the rest of their lives in this rapidly shrinking world we live in.
If we, say, keep the search criteria to 2009 and never, the list is... ... Mostly small SUVs and a couple of Pickups and a couple of coupes. Almost nothing that's a sedan and that's also not a sub-compact or compact car. I'd give BMW and Mercedes a pass on size due to their safety record, but certainly nothing domestic that's small.
Case in point - my Mustang. It's a base model with a V6. If you disable the speed limiter, it will outperform a Porsche 928 in every single measure. Now, true, a 928 was designed in the late 70s. But at the time, it was the best supercar in the world. Fast forward to 2014. A $20K car has that level of performance. It's never been a better time to be a driver. Except that humans haven't evolved into better new drivers in such a short period of time. When you can get 200+HP in the most basic sedans these days, it worries me. I'd rather see 120HP and 50mpg, to be honest, instead of 200HP and 30mpg. It really makes me miss cars like the Volvo 240 that I had. Fun, solid, easy to drive, and no way was I going to get in trouble.
We grew up with cars that could go 0-60 in about 15 seconds. Now any idiot can stomp on the pedal and go 0-60 in 6 seconds. And we consider those cars to be ""slow"", even.
BTW, my favorite car I have owned? A Volvo 164E. My second? My 67 Mercedes S Class. The Mustang is great because it's $20K and a fantastic commuter-box alternative. Not because it's my favorite car of all time."
[Deleted User],Apr-14,"plekto: We all like to argue here, so I hope you take nothing personally. I know you like the 3.7 Mustang, and I bet your son likes it even more that you do... especially when he imagines himself driving it as his first car. I have 3 daughters, of which one is 13, so I will be facing this choice too.
I really think it is a great idea to teach him stick shift, but man I would worry about one of my girls driving stick in this area. Congested, aggressive, and dangerous.
With that said, I drove all kinds of jalopies when I was a young driver, but because I had a father who brought me up to respect the law, be careful, and practice defensive driving, I survived.
So, whether you get him an 05 Accord, or an 07 Corolla; what matters most is that he had a parent that sought out advice and did his due diligence to make sure his son will be as safe as possible in whatever reasonable car is selected."
backy,Apr-14,"Well, that's not really true, is it... you'd rather see the higher-horsepower, lower-MPG vehicle. A vehicle like your Mustang. You've voted with your wallet regarding what kind of car you'd rather see. That 120 HP, 50 MPG vehicle exists, for about the same price you paid for your Mustang. It's called a gently-used Prius. Or with a little more HP, a gently-used Jetta or Golf TDI.
But you chose the Mustang, and that's your prerogative, it's your car. But some of us really would rather see a low-HP, high-MPG car. Some of us own cars like that. And maybe also a 200 HP, 30 MPG (35+ highway) car for the wife."
m6user,Apr-14,"I think a 4-5 yr old Accord, Mazda6, Camry, Altima or Sonata with a 4 cyl and a stick would fit the bill nicely. The OP seems to want a sedan and may have very solid reasons for it. Why do some, instead of asking or assuming they put some thought into it, try to ""sell"" them on anything but. Is it just because that is their personal preference? A 4cyl sedan certainly isn't going to go 0-60 in 6 seconds.....more like 8 or 8.5 secs. True, that is plenty quick enough for a teenager but certainly not v-6 fast. There are plenty of those type sedans around with a stick if one really is dead set on getting one.
Personally, I think a compact sedan would be even more ideal as long as it is fairly recent vintage to allow for all the more recent safety enhancements. Don't see a huge difference between compact and midsize in that respect. However, the OP did query the ""midsized sedans"" forum."
stickguy,Apr-14,"OP never mentioned a manual trans though IIRC. that certainly limits your options. But, there is this, even though it might turn them off of driving forever.

Michaell,Apr-14,"Having lived through 2 teenaged drivers, I've learned that every vehicle can be driven fast enough to get into trouble. Stepson spent most of his permit time behind the wheel of an '03 Explorer, so he was quite used to the high center of gravity of an SUV. He also attended drivers training. We bought him a gently used GEO Tracker as his first car. 90 HP, what could go wrong?
A lot, as it turns out. Rolled the Tracker not 5 weeks after purchase, sent his sister to the hospital via helicopter. Everybody was OK, but kids think they're immortal at that age. Doesn't matter what they're driving.
Sedans are the cheapest to insure, and the safety features now available may mitigate some of the inevitable stupidity behind the wheel (multiple airbags, ABS, TCS, etc.).
Let's hope the OP has a kid whose head is screwed on straight - that, more that the car they are driving, will determine if they make it out of their teens."
backy,Apr-14,"Just don't get one of those turbo 4 cylinder Sonatas (or Optimas)! Those'll do pretty close to 6 seconds 0-60.
I agree a used mid-sizer can be a nice vehicle for a 20-something person. If budget is tight, the 2003-7 Accord, 2003-8 Mazda6, 2002-6 Altima, 2006-10 Sonata, 2006.5-10 Optima, 2006-12 Fulan, even the 2002-6 Camry. And if you have more money, you can get the next generation up. Last summer, I bought a 2005 Mazda6i Sport hatch for $4900 that my 18-year-old daughter drives to school now, and she loves it. (The problem is, I love it too but I don't get to drive it much!)"
stickguy,Apr-14,"there is a reason I bought a NA Volvo S40 a couple years ago when my daughter got her permit, and she is still driving it. And it isn't because it is fast! She complains on occasion about it being slow, but I don't care, since I don't drive it. Plus she hasn't figured out if she floors it, it accelerates plenty quick. And I don't see any real reason to tell her.
My son (the older one) started out with a 4 cyl AT Contour. now that car was a dog. He hated it, I hated it. But again, slow and a nice manageable size to start with. He was better prepared when he got a fast car (the TL) about 8 months later, and that was a fluke because it fell into our laps. Thankfully he never had an accident with it, or got a ticket that counted. It is a pretty quick car, but not hyper fast around town. It just always wants to settle at 80 on the highway."
plekto,Apr-14,"Well, the quote function seems to be broken. But about the choice in cars, I think the latest crop of 30mpg (highway) 300 HP cars are great. For a second or third vehicle. Yes, I did vote with my pocketbook, but I still think that 300hp is completely overkill, even though the car is fun. I bought it mostly because they don't make most midsize, sporty, or entry level luxury cars in the 20-30K range with manual any more. Your mileage will of course vary a lot.
I keep thinking about it and... Maybe a 4 cylinder Accord with manual? But it's such a bland car in the basic trim that you have to get to get manual. Someone else did mention a Volvo S40, but they're kind of expensive to fix. Maybe a Subaru Impreza wagon?
Well, I'm still looking. Heh. I have about 1 year to do something about this."
suydam,Apr-14,"It's not just that teenagers think they are immortal, although they do. They are inexperienced. Big, old and slow was my motto. My son totaled his first car within 3 weeks of getting his license. Thank God he and everyone else was fine and also thank God it wasn't an expensive new car. He learned from that mistake and has a perfect driving record since. I leaned towards older Buicks and Camrys in those days. One son inherited my fathers Accord and that was good too. Bland is good when it comes to teenagers! Fortunately now most cars from 2000 up are going to have the main safety features like air bags and ABS."

I think you and I are in tune with this topic.
Also, I spent my learners permit time with a 1978 Plymouth Trail Duster 4x4, (rust killed it) then a 1983 Dodge K car wagon, with ""rich Corinthian"" red vinyl interior, (mom-mobile) a 1979 Fiat Strata, (the answer to why Fiat left country) and then finally I financed my own '87 Cavalier Z (freedom at last).
None of those cars had airbags or safety equipment of any kind. The Fiat (neighbor gave me for free) had no window cranks, interior door handles, heat or vent, or gauges of any kind.
I had to leave the windows down all summer, and drilled holes in the floor to let the rain out. Anyway, I survived."
dash5,Apr-14,My son is only 6 but reading this conversation is interesting. I wonder what he will be driving in 10 years. Maybe something Tesla-esque.
stickguy,Apr-14,I would rather have 175 HP and 40 mpg highway instead of 30/300. Something like an Altima or Mazda 6 has a very good balance if great mpg and plenty quick enough (low to mid 7s 0-60).
rbirns1,Apr-14,"Stepped away for the weekend and came back to a bunch of nice replies. Thanks to all.
As follow up, compact cars are out. Kid is 6-5, let's give him a little room. Manual is also out, thanks to NY-area traffic.

Learn to drive a stick once everything else is second nature."
m6user,Apr-14,"Hey, you make a lot of sense but prepare for the onslaught of ""OMG, he has to learn a stick first"" fanatics. I will say one good thing about driving a stick is that it keeps the hands busy and off the cell phones! But then again, maybe not, and that would be even more dangerous. Good luck."
suydam,Apr-14,"No, my daughter admitted to me not long ago that as a teenager, she became adept at driving with her knees while texting. Manual transmission would not matter. Most of them do survive just fine, but a trustworthy vehicle ups the odds at least. My first two learned to drive without any modern safety features except air bags, but I made sure my third had them all. Take advantage of the modern era! By the way, my sons are both over 6 feet, and they did fine in a Buick LeSabre, Mazda 626 (back then), Honda Accord, and Toyota Camry. Midsize is a good choice."

[Deleted User],Apr-14,"Here in VA the new texting while driving law that went into effect last July is all full of holes. It is illegal to text, but entering an address in GPS and dialing a phone # is exempt.
Also, if your vehicle is ""lawfully parked"" you can do whatever you want. So, technically texting at a stoplight is just fine.
It was only when I saw a county cop typing on his laptop at the light on my street(which are strapped into all police cars here, and probably most everywhere) AND entering something on his cellphone when I realized why the law is full of holes.
So, I was really happy when yesterday it was announced that if you cause an accident while using a cell phone that involves injury and property damage, you can get one year in jail, and pay up to a $5000 fine. I can't imagine how awful it must be for parents to lose their children over an unimportant text message. Myself included."

I see all these new oils don't need tomb be changed for up to a year, but I have been programmed (by big oil?) to bring mine in every 5000 miles. I never thought 3,000 miles was necessary, but I never let it go longer than 5k.
Does anyone have some inside info on how these oils work? What about the tiny metal shavings that I have been told do all kinds of damage to an ICE unless we change the oil very frequently?"
explorerx4,Apr-14,"I get the oil changed and tires rotated every 5K, mostly because I like to get the tires rotated."

http://www.edmunds.com/car-care/stop-changing-your-oil.html"
ahightower,Apr-14,"Should have been more clear. Took a different new job, closer to home. As for oil changes, the Accord has an oil life monitor and tells you when to change. It went about 7500 miles before the first was required. That used to seem long to me, but it became my habit on my last car. Our 2005 Yukon also has a monitor that usually recommends a change around 6500 miles. I always use a name brand synthetic oil and a high quality filter (usually Mobil 1). Even that is probably not strictly necessary as the owners manual said conventional is fine, but I reckon it's worth the extra $15 given the time/distance it allows, and the oppressive summer heat around here."
Michaell,Apr-14,"While I don't own a mid-size myself, I know several folks who do.
One of them has a 2011 or 2012 Optima Hybrid. Found out that after 36,000 miles the entire transmission has to be rebuilt. Covered under warranty, but this is a person who took his last car (Corolla) to 230K, so he's understandably upset that he needs such a major repair done so early in the car's life.

The newest Chrysler complaints surround using the same dash hardware whether it's a Dart or a Viper. This is done by every conglomerate, but it has to be done artfully.
Now with the Fiat merger, even the Maserati Ghibli fhas the 8.4' touchscreen and all the power window controls, buttons, and do-dads from your average minivan. The engine block is plucked straight from the Chrysler plant and sent to Ferrari (thankfully) to have the engine fully Italianized. The automotive community called the Ghibli ""half baked"".

Another poster mentioned about the Durango. Which i agree. Very nice reviews... Ride and handling , Quiet inside the cabin, Looks sharp.. Amazing how pricey this suv is as you go up in models.
My concern with this dodge truck is : If i wanted to buy the upscale version durango in excess of 40k and wanted to keep it 8 or 10 years "" How much money will i have to shell out to keep it Intact and running like its competition would. Owning Three or 4 years who cares if your leasing or going to sell it.
That would be my concern. I would never consider a Dodge vehicle anyway.... Sorry Dodge. Work harder to make a better product. Re-sale value on dodge vehicles are bad
What are your thoughts .................... am i off base with this."
ahightower,Apr-14,"This is cool. Props to enthusiasts no matter our state in life. Maybe I'll steal the show at Cars & Coffee when I'm old and rich, but for now, I still take pride in my car. Glad y'all are having fun up there.

Kia moved up from 233 in 2008 to 151 in 2014. A big difference. My transmission is back to normal and showed no sign pf problems on my way to yesterdays event, which took 55 minutes to go 13 miles on I-95.
....and with that said,
We had the 1st annual Optima/K5 owners meet yesterday. About 20 people showed up, with a total of 10 cars. The new 2014 SX Turbo in SWP (Snow White Pearl) really stole the show. Pictures don't do it justice. It has the best wheels I have ever seen on a mid size. The bodywork was just beautiful, with little accents in all the right places. Anyway, a good turnout considering a one week notice. Every model was represented, The owners (and their friends) were very nice, and all opened up their cars for anyone to sit in and thoroughly examine. We are already planning a fall meet, and hope to include the Sonata boards, and anyone else in a mid-size is welcome!"

[Deleted User],Apr-14,"Right. I agree that Chrysler-Fiat has made great strides in improving quality, as of late, but the same promising improvements were made with its merger to Mercedes. The 300 was supposed to be America's $30k Mercedes, and it was arguably successful. It is still made today and is a very handsome vehicle.
Unfortunately, it has only been a short time since the Durango was one of the worst built vehicles our proud country had to offer, and many potential buyers like myself are old enough to remember Fiat's with bits that would break off in your hand. I owned one.
Then again, I also owned a 1986 Audi 5000s*, with the s meaning something that I can't say here, but they now make cars that are desirable worldwide.
Let's hope Chrysler and Fiat make happy whoopee together and the merger stands the test of time, because what they both need now is stability, long term.
No my 5000 did not have unintended acceleration, but it did have unintended engine, electrical, coolant, and brake failures repeatedly until being dropped off at the junkyard."
nyccarguy,Apr-14,"@brian125‌
I think the Durango is really sharp looking and gets fantastic reviews. I agree there is a certain degree of sticker shock when you look at the window of a HEMI powered, decked out Durango. You of all people have got to know that you (the educated, patient buyer) are not going to pay anywhere close to what it says on the sticker. The dealer in Greenwich still advertises they have 2013s on the lot that you can save ""over $9,000"" on. If I wasn't hell bent on keeping my wife's Pilot until the wheels fall off, I'd give a steeply discounted Durango a serious look.
The depreciation on the American full size trucks is steep. As far as keeping them on the road, maintenance costs are minimal. My Dad has a 2011 LTZ Tahoe. In 2 years & 54,000 miles it has been back to the dealer exactly once. Our general mechanic in The Bronx does all the maintenance on it. He's still on the original tires. Compare that to my Mom's former 2011 V6 Cayenne which required $6,000 worth of maintenance in a similar time period.
Sorry to hijack the mid sized sedan thread with SUV chat."

dash5,Apr-14,The new Camry. I'm impressed
brian125,Apr-14,"Not bad at all... Is there a pic of the back and rear lights.. Is above the sports model?
The new 2015 Toyota Camry is expected to come with some improvement in exterior and interior design as well as the improvement under the hood.
It has got much more luxurious look, better headlights and it’s a lot more comfortable than the previous model. If you want to travel relaxed and make your trip more enjoyable and funny, the new 2015 Toyota Camry has got the latest technology multimedia player.
It is said that the design for the 2015 Toyota Camry is suited to the taste of customers. However, its style will compete the other sedans in the class. Some of them are Chevrolet Malibu and Mondeo-based Ford Fusion. We expect the new 2015 Toyota Camry to provide a larger interior and more advanced technology.
THE NEW ENGINE OF THE 2015 TOYOTA CAMRY
We assume that the 2015 Toyota Camry engine will be better. It is expected that there will be a plug-in hybrid Camry and a CVT style transmission in its base model cars. The Valvematic system will probably be a part of Camry cars that will be made in the future. We expect three drive-trains: the base hybrid and the advanced. The new 2015 Toyota Camry will have four- and six-cylinder engines and hybrid. The most of them will have a 2.5 – liter four cylinders. The new Camry will offer a V – 6 engine, a 3,5 – liter but only in SE and XLE models. It will be possible to drive on gasoline and electricity.
All in all, it is not expected that the new 2015 Toyota Camry will add any new features that will attract some new buyers. Toyota could have a power driver’s seat, the leather upholstery, heated front seats and a navigation system in its base price. Instead of that, buyers will have them in a V – 6 XLE or optional in a four – cylinder XLE."

And you sure don't want to be credited for writing whatever that was. It sounds like some of the directions I get with items made in China."
akirby,Apr-14,Yep - that's the one I saw a few months ago in the focus group. Definite improvement over the current one but I don't see it taking any sales away from the others. The rest of the focus group agreed - for whatever that was worth.
stickguy,Apr-14,Does look nicer but not a high bar to jump. Interior though has possibilities.
m6user,Apr-14,"I agree that it probably won't take away many sales from others. But, it should allow Toyota to sell them a lot closer to MSRP and make a ton more money on them and probably increasing the turnover buying rate of existing Camry owners.
Here is an excerpt from cars.com on the new Sonata.
""The base engine is a 185-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-cylinder, and a 245-hp, turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder comes in the Sport 2.0T trim level. Both engines make less peak power than their predecessors but have improved responsiveness at lower engine rpm, according to Hyundai. A six- speed automatic is the only transmission offered.""
Pretty significant HP reductions. I wonder if they are just trying to stay ahead of critics who have said for years that their HP ratings are out of whack. When you look at 0-60 time comparisons it always made me wonder why they weren't beating the hell out of the competition when they had som much more HP on paper."
stickguy,Apr-14,Camry us already the sales leader. How many more could they take?
stickguy,Apr-14,Fair trade on the Sonata if they up torque and mpg.
dash5,Apr-14,"I think the new Camry is bad for the Sonata. What's their advantage now? It had been something nice looking parked in your driveway, value pricing, better features and interior. New Camry looks great and has a better reputation, more reliable... and still has those giant buttons inside so granny can see them"
rbirns1,Apr-14,"Those Camry pics are an improvement (pretty low bar to reach), but that front end looks like a bad moustache. The interior may be improved, but it still doesn't look as upscale as Accord, Altima, Sonata, and other competitors."
Mr_Shiftright,Apr-14,"Looks like they pretty much re-worked the Camry from the chassis on up, although the roofline looks familiar. A major overhaul, to be sure."

[Deleted User],Apr-14,"The new Camry looks great although I am tired of the giant grill look. Very nice inside and out.

ahightower,Apr-14,Enough with the largemouth bass look. I fail to see how the illusion of a gaping hole in the front of the car is an improvement over a body colored bumper. Even Audi is finally toning it down a bit.

Robr2
Do all of todays bumpers have this steel bar.
I was under the impression that most of the newer car bumpers are made from reaction injection molded polyurethane plastic or Thermoplastic Olefins. Polypropylene foam is usually found inside bumpers to absorb impact during a collision, while better bumper systems may have hydraulic shock absorbers as well to provide extra protection.
ahightower- .............. I agree this front grille open space is ugly and unsafe in a collision."
explorerx4,Apr-14,That's the second time I thought that was a Corolla not a Camry.
berri,Apr-14,"Maybe it's just the camera angles, but it looks like they went to a shorter, less useful center armrest inside. I'm probably a minority, but I'm not that into stitched dashboard covers. I prefer a cleaner, smoother look. At least they got rid of those evil looking Asian tail lights on the current model. I'm with those who say ditch the big mouth bass look...and why mimic the bottom grill style of the Lexus - looks too much like a '61 Plymouth. I think that Google spy shot front end looks better than the old steam locomotive cow catcher look in the new model pictures."
backy,Apr-14,"Exactly. I had the same thought. Also thought about the Cylon comparison someone else brought up. The C pillar looks awful (and cheap), IMO. The interior is a minor improvement but still looks cheap to me--the center stack reminds me of the previous-gen Corolla's.
No, I much prefer the looks of the new Sonata. It looks like a more mature car than the current generation, sleek (0.27 Cd) without trying to be in-your-face. Bigger greenhouse, bigger interior (with height-adjustable passenger seat at last!), lots of improvements under the skin, more safety features, more convenience features (like ""smart trunk""). I also like the clean lines of the interior; a more European feel vs. gimmicky Asian feel. Lots of little pushbuttons on the center stack, though--I prefer simple rotary controls ala the Mazda6.
Yep, the new Sonata will definitely be worth a look when the lease is up on my wife's 2013 in 18 months. Camry... not so much."
[Deleted User],Apr-14,"Audi eye liner for sure. Lol. ""Large Mouth Bass look"" is well said. Done with it."

ab348,Apr-14,I still don't like the Dashmat treatment on the passenger side where it rides up over the rightmost AC vent.
backy,Apr-14,"You really like that new interior on the Camry? Do you like it more than, say, the interior on your Optima? I don't. I'll take the interior on the Optima any day over the Camry... also I'd take the interior of the Mazda6, Accord, 200, and even my old Sonata let alone the new one.
And that front end on the Camry... I think it screams, ""Hey look at me, I got me a racin' car, not some boring Camry!"" But as far as Cylons go, I'll take Number Six any day over that Camry."
brian125,Apr-14,"Isn't it amazing that whatever Toyota does with its camry design and interior they are always at the top of best selling sedan. If there dash had a 2ft open circle in the middle "" This sedan would still out sell most "" You talk about the gods shinning down on this vehicle"
m6user,Apr-14,"I've never been able to tell just by a photo if an interior is ""cheap"" or not. The Camry interior from just looking at the pictures seems ok, not great but impossible to tell if if the switch gear or materials are cheap or not. Looks like a big improvement though. The exterior is a lot better from the side and rear but have to agree the front is not pretty in the photos. Have to see it in person to really get a good feel for it. Sometimes one dimension doesn't do a car justice. I remember thinking the Sonata was a real mess (in pictures) when it came out for 2011 but after seeing it in person I like it. Some people wouldn't like a Camry if it was beautiful, had 250 hp and got 45mpg."
dash5,Apr-14,"I'll take a 6 and an 8 Cylon, Boomer is hot.
I like the new Camry interior, not better than my Optima SX but it's miles better than it was when I last looked in a Camry. Same with the exterior. Toyota already sells a ton of Camrys, the knock has been boring looks and (imo) stunningly bad interiors, They still do the reliable, comfortable, efficient, economical thing well. Now they are closing the gap on the style. Sonata/Optima twins really pushed this as well as the Fusion and now Camry has to try and keep it's lead that is being eaten into year by year."
[Deleted User],Apr-14,"Backy- the new Camry interior is better than the old one. I also hate the dash mat on the passenger side. AND I also do not like the C pillar. There is no ""upkick"" to the window by the C pillar. The windows are just flat all the way across the beltline.
The front end of the B&W picture was meant to look ""cinched"" like their Lexus lineup. It is better than the bass-o-matic 76 in the color photo.
I think the base model Passat is the most boring mid-size on the market. I also notice that non of us has even mentioned a Malibu in months. Listen to the silence Chevy! It speaks volumes.
Boomer is totally gorgeous. #6 creeps me out. I think I would need a safe word w/her. Like don't kill me."
rbirns1,Apr-14,Totally. Very disappointing as the previous generation Passat (96-05) was the classiest car in the segment. That mid-2000's style would sell very well today.
brian125,Apr-14,"Mike Horn has just taken over his new role as CEO in jan, 2014.. Hopefully he can resurrect the Passat.
Horn, who had been head of Volkswagen AG's global aftersales operations, also is going on offense in Volkswagen's hometown of Wolfsburg. He is pushing his German bosses to launch products designed specifically for the American market, starting with a U.S.-focused version of the German-made Tiguan compact crossover. The current Tiguan is less popular with American customers than rivals such as the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4."
stickguy,Apr-14,the Jetta and Passat are already US only spec.
backy,Apr-14,"Wait, what's that sound coming from the Malibu? Scratch scratch scratch... what IS that?? Oh... it's the sound of Chevy digging its own grave with deceit, and contempt for human life, like the rest of GM.
I have to admit, it's clever for Toyota to channel the Cylons on the new Camry. We all know how Number Six got into Baltar's head. Toyota figures that will happen to car buyers... that new Camry will get into their heads, make them see visions of driving up to concert halls, hauling the Final Five around town (with plenty of elbow room!), gliding smoothly over the war-torn streets of Caprica, holding up against blasts from battlestars with its stronger structure. Yes, it all makes sense now..."
[Deleted User],Apr-14,"I totally agree on the Malibu. Chevy should not have decreased rear seat legroom, Impala or no Impala. Also backy, I do like my Optima's Optimal dash layout better than most other mid size's. However,
I find the new Camry interior to be well laid out and it appears to have good materials and fit/finish, plus it still has real knobs instead of (or at least in addition to) infuriating touchscreens.
Anyway, I found these new 2015 Hyundai Sonata pictures from the new Motor Trend. Check them out!!
http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/sedans/1404_2015_hyundai_sonata_first_look/photo_75.html"
rbirns1,Apr-14,That 2015 Sonata looks like a current Fusion with a 90's Ford interior. I think it's a step backward.
[Deleted User],Apr-14,"http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/sedans/1404_2015_hyundai_sonata_first_look/#ixzz2zFvqs800
Here are the specs from the same Motortrend article above:
""Power figures in the 2015 Hyundai Sonata are down compared with the 2014 model, and that's just as well, considering the overstated mileage issues Hyundai and Kia had late in 2012. The 2.4-liter direct-injection I-4 powering most 2015 Sonatas now produces 185 hp and 178 lb-ft of torque. (The 2014 model had 190-192 hp and 179-181 lb-ft, while the 2011 model had 198-200 hp.) By reducing peak power, Hyundai says the car will be more responsive at lower RPMs, a helpful change that could improve drivers' real-world mileage.
More on Automobilemag.com:2015 Hyundai Sonata Revealed in Korea
The turbocharged 2.0-liter engine returns in the 2015 Hyundai Sonata 2.0T, tweaked for better responsiveness and lower-end torque. Using a turbocharger that has a smaller turbine and compressor wheel, the engine is rated at 245 hp and 260 lb-ft, compared to the 2014 model's 274 hp and 269 lb-ft. We've had mixed results with the turbo-four available in the Sonata and mechanically related Kia Optima, so we're eager to see how this version performs. Both engines are mated to a six-speed automatic transmission. EPA fuel economy isn't yet available, but the outgoing 2014 Sonata is rated 24/35 mpg city/highway, off the pace of the Nissan Altima (27/38 mpg) and non-Sport-trimmed Honda Accord (27/36 mpg, with 26/34 mpg for the Sport), but on par with the 2014 Toyota Camry (25/35 mpg).""
I am not sure about a step backward, but I am sure it isn't much of a step forward. They have dropped 29 HP on the Turbo and 15 on the 2.4. They can say they tuned the motor(s) for better this-and-that; but the real deal is that Hyundai has been exaggerating all along, and these new figures are more realistic.
Maybe my 2012 Optima EX 2.4 does have 200 HP, but if it does, it's only between 5200 to 5201 RPM, with 185 before and after. Ditto for the turbo.
On the styling. I think Hyundai was going for a more ""crisp"" look, but I am inclined to agree that it isn't more attractive. I will reserve further judgement until I see the Sonata in person."
Mr_Shiftright,Apr-14,"The new Camry is getting a tremendous amount of buzz right now in the media, as is the new Sonata, and even the Subaru Outlook is being complimented on styling--I never knew Subaru even HAD a styling department."
nyccarguy,Apr-14,"All these new for 2015 models coming out mean one thing, fire sale prices and super cheap lease deals on 2014 leftovers which will most likely be on the lot when I'm ready to pull the trigger over labor day weekend:)"
rbirns1,Apr-14,"@cski, I was only referring to the look, not the specs."
ab348,Apr-14,"I agree that the new Sonata looks like a very large step backwards. I do not like the current model but it seems Hyundai has overreacted to criticism of the extra-swoopy styling by going conservative like they used to be. As for the reduced HP, I suspect it is more a matter of their marketing dept getting reined in and being forced to be honest instead of exaggerating their numbers, as Hyundai has been notorious for doing.
That MT article is a joke - sounds like a press release or an apologist's defense of some very questionable decisions."
benjaminh,Apr-14,"In terms of looks, it seems like the new Sonata has gone from radical/strange to boring/strange. Fish mouth to bad Fusion clone? I don't like either one that much, but the old one looks better to me. In terms of power and mpg there doesn't seem to be any big improvement. Maybe the interior is a step up?"
benjaminh,Apr-14,"I like the new Camry's interior better, but the new front grill seems strange and overwrought. With some of these new cars, you almost want to say: ""Close your mouth!""
I'd still say the best looking midsize cars are the Mazda6, Fusion, Optima, and Accord."
backy,Apr-14,"And this is coming from someone who loves the Accord? Now THAT'S ""strange"".
Hyundai took a lot of flak for its out-there styling on the 2011 Sonata, and the related low greenhouse. So they've sharpened its creases, opened up the greenhouse (with better rear-seat access, from reviews), de-cluttered the interior, and from looks of it made a lot of improvements in ride & drive, safety, and convenience.
At least one review I read compares the looks of the Sonata, A-pillar back, to an A4. Which is interesting because Audi was the inspiration for the styling of the 2006-10 generation--a ""boring"" styling job, but one that's held up well over time IMO. I'm not crazy about the new grille, but that's on the upmarket trim. I haven't seen a pic of the base Sonata yet. At least the Sonata's grille is smaller than the humongous mouth on the new Genesis. Now that's one ugly face, IMO."
[Deleted User],Apr-14,"Yes, it is like, plastic in the front. I know they are going for modern and ""crisp"" styling, but man, I think Hyundai was very very worried about the Fusion, so they tried to make the Sonata grill stick out more.. It's a mess frankly. Really. The more I look at the Sonata the more I dislike it.
I do like he black and white Camry picture. They at least made the stolen Audi eyeliner and the IS-250 F sport grill work together.

Maybe it should be called an Audry SE-F-Sport A6"
ivan_99,Apr-14,"I love the look of the new Sonata.
The, now prev gen, looked amazing when first released but began to look dated quickly (for me anyway...).
I find the creased style more appealing than swoopy/bulbous style. I don't find any of the latest mid-size styles appalling...they range from non-offensive to pretty-nice..."

[Deleted User],Apr-14,"Well, since no one was talking I looked around for more 2015 models, and wallah, here is the 2015 Volkswagen Passat. Looks like they put the current model on a tension-test machine and just stretched it. Anything is better than the breadbox express featured at dealers today.
It's funny how fickle the world is on these things, including myself. It looks pretty much the same as the current model. Has a bit if CC in it.
Here is the new 2015 Altima Hybrid:

Enjoy."
backy,Apr-14,"At least the Passat won't resemble an old Impala any more. Now it will look just like Every Other Mid-Sized Sedan with a Hofmesiter Kink. The tail is pretty nice, even if nothing special. But as Toyota found, flash doesn't sell tons of mid-sized sedans. Keep the interior nice and roomy and put the new high-mpg gas powertrain in the Passat (along with the turbodiesel), and it should sell just fine."
[Deleted User],Apr-14,Resembling an old impala was funny. I hated that car. There was nothing about it I found remotely interesting. Funny how 15 years later that I think the new Impala is beautiful. The black LTZ with dark tan Interior at the auto show attracted men like flies.
explorerx4,Apr-14,"To me, the Passat looked like a tri 9 Caprice.
Now the back looks like a Buick Lucerne. I guess that's moving upscale.
I think the new Impala looks a lot like a Sonata from the back."
brian125,Apr-14,Nice clean lines on the new 2015 Passat... I like how the back end looks.............. Big improvement. I would need to see it in person to get the full effect of the redesign. Looks like a swing and miss inside the car thou.. Has that cheap looking Ford dash and interior from years ago.
explorerx4,Apr-14,"@brian125,
If you are looking at the interior picture below the Passat, that is the Altima interior.
A little thin chrome trim in a few places would improve the look a lot."
[Deleted User],Apr-14,"!
I should have separated the Altima pictures better. VW would never have an interior like the Altima. I think the center stack knobs look cheap, but other than that it looks good 2B honest."
brian125,Apr-14,Sometimes pictures do no justice
ahightower,Apr-14,"Agreed the picture is not flattering. I remember really liking the interior of the Altima (SL) at the auto show. Good materials, good leg room. Liked it enough to test drive one. The SV which was in my price range was significantly less appealing, primarily because the cloth upholstery was so chintzy."
ahightower,Apr-14,"Also got a good tour of my sister's boyfriend's Camry SE over the weekend. The leather was nice, but almost all other materials felt relatively cheap. Made me appreciate the texture and heft of the knobs and buttons in my Accord. The touch screen had decent graphics but was small and lacked some functions. The previous-gen Camry is just that - previous gen. Perhaps the new one will catch up in all the little details that give a more premium feel."
plekto,Apr-14,"Don't count on it. With the ever-decreasing value of the dollar, and intense price competition by the makers, they are cutting corners in every way that they can find. I've found that the beauty is only skin deep with many new cars. It's beautiful, but quite literally it's very thin and lightweight. I don't expect most of them to have their interiors, accessories, switchgear last even a decade of normal use."
ral2167,Apr-14,"I don't understand the Camry dissing I see. I don't think the current gen is a bad looking car. I kinda like it. Not sure what the allure is of cars with huge grills like the Fusion (and the 2015 Camry). What makes the Accord more attractive than the Camry? I drove the Accord and they can't get the Blind Spot Monitoring right-- couldn't they just have lights on the side mirrors that light up, like most cars? Plus the radio doesn't compare with the Camry. I'm not knocking these other cars-- the Accord and Fusion I am sure are really nice cars, and if you like the looks, great. I think the Mazda 6 is the most attractive of all. Any way, I sure do read non-Camry owners knocking the looks of the current Camry, and I kind of like it, especially in that Cypress Pearl color. ."
backy,Apr-14,"I like the exterior of the current Camry (as pictured above) better than the looks of that update for 2015. The current car is at least non-offensive. It's the interior that isn't competitive, IMO.
I agree the Mazda6 is the best-looking mid-sized car right now. I like the Optima also, and the Accord and Fusion are pretty nice also. I need to see the new Sonata in person and in some color other than that garish orange; I don't think that's the best color for that car."
[Deleted User],Apr-14,"Unfortunately we are a fickle bunch, and so is the American consumer. There isn't anything wrong with the outside of the Camry; it's just that it doesn't aspire to be anything more. More to the point it's the inside. It looks like it was put together by committee. The fake soft touch aluminum (I didn't even know that WAS a material) can be dented and scratched off with your fingernail, the giant slab of fake wood around the shifter is not exactly cutting edge, and the seat material wouldn't be out of place in a Boeing product. When most of the competition reached for more, Toyota just didn't. I am sure it will be as reliable as a Frigidaire, but it just doesn't make me want to go down and buy one.
I also very much agree with you on the giant grill issue. I am not into it either.
Still glad I bought the 2012 Optima EX. No huge grill, nice looks, great inside materials, long warranty, slick 200 hp / 6 speed auto, and a very reasonable sticker. Add the eye candy like dual pipes, fog lights, and nice looking 17"" alloys, and I would write the check today just as I did two years ago.
I agree with backy on the 2015 Camry styling. I would stick with the 2014 SE ( or the SE V6 w/268HP) if I was to buy a Camry today."
brian125,Apr-14,"How about the GM news today. The hits just keep on comming for this company.. GM is being investigated for its new braking system failure on the Impala's.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating a report that the 2014 Chevy Impala's emergency braking system activated multiple times without warning. A driver says that in one instance, the Impala was traveling 40 miles-per-hour when the brakes activated. The car was struck in the rear by another vehicle. No injuries were reported. Federal regulators are trying to determine if the alleged defect is widespread.
The investigation is not related to GM's recent recall of 2,600,000 older model Chevrolet and other cars for defective ignition switches. An estimated 60,580 Impalas of the 2014 model year are on U.S. roads."
brian125,Apr-14,"The front of the 2015 Camry gets a incomplete from me with that bottom grille. Awful look.. What were they thinking. I could live with the look of the new Avalon front. Not this Camry.
Sorry Camry!! You had a chance to step up to the big boys table... but slipped in the bathroom in the looks dept.
A much better look would of been solid bumper all around the bottom ."
ivan_99,Apr-14,"Maybe the criticism is more vocal. I think the current one is fine. I like a few other designs more...but not by much.
The rear end of the current one irks me...can't stand the rear lights. To me it looks like they took that theme and applied it to the front of the new design. It seems like somebody with limited design experience attempted to make something look cool (like something i'd do...)
But as you pointed out, there are many other qualities that make up vehicle. Fusion is my champ for design...but I could be persuaded into another when significant $'s are at stake."
brian125,Apr-14,"Ivan,...see I disagree..... I find the front of the Fusion just as bad as this Camry. I like the inside of the Fusion. I would never buy the ford nor the camry. I liked the 2011 style Sonata. the New style I hate. I guess beauty is in the eye of the beholder.. Not that i think my Accord is much better in the looks dept. I like the look of my V-6 Accord in the front, but not so much the back."
[Deleted User],Apr-14,"I just this very minute came in from driving around the block in a rental Fusion Hybrid. My neighbs's rented it to go to Niagara Falls. Aside from the personal choice of the grill, the only problem I have with the interior is the materials around the MFT/SYNC. The touch controls worked fine. There was no appreciative lag between touch and response.(It is a Feb 2014 build) It just doesn't have any indentation on where to touch, which means that you have to look down every time you change a function (or do it on the wheel). The materials are actually REALLY good everywhere but that one center stack area. It is weird driving with no sound whatsoever. My first hybrid trip. Anyway, that's about it."
explorerx4,Apr-14,"Exterior-wise the Accord is the most mature and balanced, but the interior in a big letdown.
Camry looks like it was designed to be as cheap as possible, but had some glitz added as an afterthought to try to dress it up.
Like most people, I think the front of the Fusion looks great, although I wish the grille was an argent color to more closely match the wheels and the interior is very well done."
[Deleted User],Apr-14,"Speaking of well done interiors, I love the new 200. Very pretty. Modern. They integrated the corporate 8.4"" touchscreen nicely, and to me is just beautiful. Now scroll up and look at the Altima's insides. Yuk."
explorerx4,Apr-14,"I'll have to actually see it, but I don't really like that wood squid arm over the center screen."
backy,Apr-14,"I don't know who decided it was a good idea to have light-colored material on a steering wheel. It will just get dirty, and it's a distraction. What's wrong with good 'ol black or dark grey? My wife's Sonata has a two-tone wheel, black with tan, not as light as the insert in the 200's wheel, and it shows every bit of grime.
The wood ""squid arm"" I can live with just fine... the wood actually wraps around the top of the center stack, and it's not that glossy crap."
berri,Apr-14,"Personally, I'm kind of tired of black - inside and outside. But I suppose I'm in the minority out there."
ab348,Apr-14,Anything is preferable to a black interior IMO.
[Deleted User],Apr-14,"LMAO. Once you see the squid arm, you always see the squid arm. Thanks for ruining that for me...
However, nothing beats having to see this every day:
In Chryslers defense it is actually real wood.
Backy, the steering wheel was mentioned in this months Motortrend as ""New York style luxury"". It doesn't bother me much color wise, but I do agree with your position on it getting dirty."
backy,Apr-14,"I'm fine with light-colored interiors. I like tan fine, and two of my cars have a tan interior. But the dash and steering wheel are black (except the tan insert on the Sonata), and I just think black is better there for less glare and not showing smudges (esp. on the wheel).
I'll bet the wood in that Benz is real, also."

brian125,Apr-14,Love the interior in the VW.
backy,Apr-14,"I actually like the 200's interior. I just don't like white leather on the steering wheel--on ANY steering wheel. And I wouldn't choose white for an interior of my car. Now, replace the white with a camel/tan or light grey, and I think it would be very sharp--and more practical than with white.
And no, I don't have white carpeting or upholstery in my home, either.
P.S. My fav interior of a low-bucks car (under $20k) has to be the 2015 Golf. Saw it at the auto show this winter and fell in love with it... excellent quality for the price. For just a little more, I think the Verano has a very nice interior. The newly-tweaked Regal has a nice interior also... getting back to mid-sized cars!"
dudleyr,Apr-14,That C30 interior is terrible. Too bad - the exterior is very nice.
mtnman1,Apr-14,"__Not sure what the allure is of cars with huge grills like the Fusion. _
ral2167 you kind of contradict your own statement when you say you don't understand the allure of cars with huge grills then state the Mazda6 is great looking. Talk about huge grills. I love the new Fusion and the Mazda6 looks pretty good as well. My favorite looking Mid Sized family Sedans are the Ford Fusion Titanium and the Optima SXL. I also love the Malibu LTZ. Just my opinions so to each his own. Isn't living in a country that still is somewhat free a great thing where we have choices."

[Deleted User],Apr-14,Me too. I wish it was in a different car. Like the new Merc GLA.
[Deleted User],Apr-14,"The new Motortrend (5/14) features an entry level luxury sedan comparo with the following four cars:
Mercedes Benz CLA250
BMW 320i
Buick Regal Turbo
VW CC R-line
The reason I brought this up is that all 4 of these cars are very close to the $30k line, but few of them arena enticing except the 320i. A tempting price of $34,900 as tested, which means of course a real price of around $30. It won the comparo.
Which car would you guys ""step up"" to, if you decided to trade your mid size in today?"
plekto,Apr-14,"I'd personally get neither. The G37 is a better car than those four in terms of what you get. Truecar has G37s listed at $29K. And that's not the absolute best price you can get, either.
Of course, if you're talking about trading in your mid-size, why necessarily get another sedan? There are plenty of hot hatches, coupes, and convertibles out there as well."
benjaminh,Apr-14,"I would definitely get the 320i. I've always really admired BMWs. But I don't think you can ever get one for 30k. Unlike the regular midsize sedans, which are discounted like crazy and have huge rebates + financing, I think BMWs are in enough demand that you'd only get c. $2k or so off of list. And it's rare to find a 320i that even lists for $35, since options often drive the price closer to 40. Things that are standard on a Civic, like a back-up camera, costs extra bucks on a BMW...."
[Deleted User],Apr-14,"There are only 2 cars I could afford on the next level up. The 320 and the A3. The A3 is too small for my family so realistically it would be the 320i with the M Sport and convenience package. Now, if I went with leasing I could get the 328i or the A4. I just can't see leasing though. When the nest is empty then I can scratch that itch.
plekto: I have 3 kids. I have to have a decent back seat!"
plekto,Apr-14,"The G37 has a larger back seat than the 3 series. The main problem I have with the 3 series is that the 1 is a better expression of the car's roots in that it's lighter, more agile, and more fun. Also, that unless you want flat black or plain white, they charge you $550 for any color paint. $31.5K is the lowest I can find a 3 series with any paint with color in it.
Audi is similar. $500 for any color other than black or white. The idea that you have a low entry-level option but it's so horridly de-contented compared to the main model that's $5K more is always a bit galling to me. That's the sort of rental-fodder trick GM made famous decades ago.
As for the best sedan for the money right now, the Ford Fusion has to be my pick."
ahightower,Apr-14,"Fun game, step up from mainstream midsize to entry luxury. I want to love the new Acura TLX. It appears to be, essentially, my Accord, but with better looks and luxury materials/features. If I could take a couple steps up... Lexus GS350 is my favorite of that class.
But given my preference for a manual transmission, I see few choices outside of BMW once you get above $30K, assuming you still want a sedan. I expect to stick with what I have until I don't need a back seat any longer, and then 70% of the grocery budget can be reallocated to driving a real sports car.
Edit:
Appears you can still get some Audis with a manual (A3, A4, S3). For comparable size though, 535 seems to be the only option. But again, I'll probably go two-door (Mustang GT, C7?) as soon as I can throw practicality back out of the equation."
stickguy,Apr-14,ATS can be had with a stick. And I think a regal.
[Deleted User],Apr-14,"This is all just a mental exercise, but I really do think after all is said and done, it will come down to BMW or Audi, and I am interested in their 3.0T engined models. I am not going with a 4 cyl on a sports car I have waited a long time for!"
plekto,Apr-14,"The new Mustang is a fantastic car if you can ignore the lack of two rear doors. I hear that the rear seat will be larger than the previous version and have more headroom, making it not so terrible for your rear passengers. Kind of like, how GM used to make 4 and 2 door versions of the same car years ago. Something to look forward to in a few years, perhaps?
As for now, I'd keep it cheap as possible and just use the car as a family beater until then. I would personally look at finding a 2-3 year old CPO C class with manual. Or an A4 with manual. Both will be close to $25K and offer you several good years of driving without having to have a part of your soul die every time you drive automatic.
note - I have nothing against automatics, but for those who want and love manuals, there is ZERO joy in anything with an automatic in it."
[Deleted User],Apr-14,"The Mustang is another car on the bucket list. Believe it or not, I have already owned one. A 79 Mustang 5.0 V8. It had 120 hp. The heater core went on it.and it sprayed antifreeze all over the cabin. Awesome."
akirby,Apr-14,I beg to differ. I just drove a Ferrari 458 Italia on a race track in full auto mode. It was faster and better than any manual. Of course the tranny also cost more than a new Fusion.
[Deleted User],Apr-14,"A Ferrari 458 in full race! Please elaborate! I think everyone will understand an off topic post for such a special occasion!
plekto: OMG, that must be why I see so many black and white BMW's, because they are base models. I didn't know that. Sure enough, the BMW 320i that M/T tested was white and had only 1 option. One other thing: there is also zero joy in replacing a clutch, throw-out bearing and pressure plate for $1800.
Traffic here kills manuals, and the legs that pump them!"

akirby,Apr-14,Listen for the downshifts - fully automatic.
dudleyr,Apr-14,Would still far prefer a manual.
Michaell,Apr-14,"Yep, I've done that here in Colorado. Ferrari 430 Convertible."
plekto,Apr-14,"I drive 70 miles a day, round trip, in Los Angeles rush hour traffic. No leg problems since I use my torque and gearing to do what I want (mostly by staying in 2nd and 3rd gear). You need to keep your speed the same and ignore small gaps in traffic in front of you. If you try to maintain the same distance all the time like in an automatic, you will kill your leg. That said, you can't pull this trick with an econobox, either, since you need a couple hundred lb-ft of torque to not bog down at lower rpms.
As for cost, I've never had to replace all of that at once. A clutch is a fraction of the cost of an automatic to replace. The automatic in a 3 series is typically between 5 and 6K to replace if it dies. I've never had to pay even half of $1800 to fix a manual, but even if I did, I could do it three times for the cost of the automatic."
dudleyr,Apr-14,"Never had to replace any part of any clutch I have ever had. 235k in Integra, 178k in Accord. Brother put 350k on a G20 stick with no clutch issues. If you are not hard on a clutch it will outlast the car."
ab348,Apr-14,"My '85 MR2 needed a throwout bearing when I sold it in 1989 with about 40,000 miles. I don't know what that does exactly, but I can't imagine it was due to abuse."
akirby,Apr-14,That's what the clutch pedal activates to disengage the clutch from the flywheel.
Mr_Shiftright,Apr-14,"Often misdiagnosed. It can only make noise with the clutch pedal pushed in. If you have a clutch type noise with the pedal released, that stops when you push in, then you probably have a transmission bearing issue."
[Deleted User],Apr-14,"It depends greatly on the car and how you drive it. My 94 SHO cost $1800 after 98k. While the trans is open you might as well replace all three clutch components. On a rear drive car it is cheaper than a front drive hot-rod Ford with a Yamaha engine. I loved that car. I believe it was a kit, now that I think of it.. A long time ago."
[Deleted User],Apr-14,
nyccarguy,Apr-14,"Replaced the clutch (throw our bearing & pressure plate) on my 2001 Prelude Type SH @ 52,000 miles to the tune of approximately $2200. This is a known problem among Type SH Preludes. Since I was spending the money, I didn't trust another Honda clutch so I replaced it with a Centerforce Clutch. With over 151,000 miles (and almost 100K on the new clutch), I think I made the right choice:)"
dudleyr,Apr-14,Something as simple as idling with the clutch depressed (instead of in neutral) is considered abuse.
ivan_99,Apr-14,"I had to replace my throwout bearing (disengages the engine from the transmission) and the clutch with just a summer of driving (when I was a teenager)...and it was because of abuse. Fun times, but expensive..."
ahightower,May-14,"I theorize that almost everyone still driving a manual is an enthusiast of sorts who actually wanted the stick and knows how to use it. At least in newer cars, anyway. There are probably some old manual beaters being tortured at the hands of novices who had no choice in what they are driving. But even on an extremely tight budget, it's hard to get ""stuck"" with a manual. Automatics are simply everywhere. I'm expecting that relative scarcity to benefit me on the resale value of my Accord down the line. While hardly a collectible, I suspect that a well-cared-for pre-owned Accord Sport 6MT will be sought out by a certain type of buyer (likes to drive, and is afraid of old Honda automatics). I'm looking at Auto Trader listings showing about 50% retained value after 150K miles... ridiculous. Lightly used (2012-newer, < 40K miles), forget about it. $20K? Might as well just buy new, which is what I did..."
[Deleted User],May-14,"Actually, when I have gone to trade in past cars with an M/T, the dealer is always like ""Well, we could give you more if it wasn't a stick""."
backy,May-14,"And that's reasonable because automatics typically add about ~$1,000 to the cost of a car, plus there is a much bigger demand for automatics. Thus I've almost always sold my non-leased cars with a stick myself, either to a family member or someone who appreciated having a stick. The only exception in the last 20+ years was a 328 Ci, and I had no problem getting a good trade-in deal on that as many 3 Series buyers prefer a stick."

Yup, the dealers are always full of horse poo. They offer you less money for a car that's a stick, then turn around and advertise it as ""rare 6-speed manual"" and ask more money than a comparable automatic:)"
akirby,May-14,The problem with a dealer taking a manual is that it only sells to a very specific customer and if you don't have that customer it can sit on the lot for months. It's the same reason they don't stock new ones either. Might be more potential profit but it's a much riskier investment.

Very suprising how bad the mazda6 gets in sales. This model should be outselling the Dodge avenger. What would make folks buy a dodge over the mazda 6 .. Maybe its price ?? If I had my choice between both vehicles mazda wins hands down . Even with there noisy engines"
stickguy,May-14,I think Mazda is still more coastal. The big part of the heartland is going to have way more dodge and Chrysler dealers. Also a more mainstream car.
brian125,May-14,"Stick,
Thoughtful answer about the heartland states. you may be right. What I always liked about those 12 heartland states is around election time they are called the Red states. Still there are 36 other states not including the 2 in the water that should make up more sales than 3800 units. Mazda reviews from CR, Motor trend, Edmunds are very good..
The only person I know that bought a 2014 Avenger bought for deep discounts on the vehicle.
Hopefully someone will come out of the woods in the heartland to helps us"
explorerx4,May-14,"There are a few Mazda dealers locally, but I still rarely see the new 6, although I just saw a new one at work.
They look decent overall, but have some bad styling areas, the grille and 'C' pillar."
Mr_Shiftright,May-14,"The Avenger is a very harmless type of car. Excels at nothing but does everything ""okay"". And yes, price."
m6user,May-14,"Mazda has probably one fourth the number of Chrysler/Dodge dealerships and outside major cities in the midwest you have to really hunt to find a Mazda dealership. Every small farm town has either a Ford, GM or Chrysler type dealership or combination of one or two. Even Toyota dealerships are fewer than the big three but they tend to be pretty big dealerships in larger towns. Also, I don't think Mazda sells a lot of the 6 to rental agencies. Also, I think a lot of government agencies buy the domestics too. Mazda is a small company like Subaru and the 3 is there bread and butter. So, bottom line, there are a lot of reasons why the Avenger, which is being sold at fire sale prices as it is being discontinued, would outsell the Mazda6 right now. Certainly not because it's a better car. If sales were the only determinant of quality than the Camry would be the best car year after year.
Just saw an article about how Mazda had more profit in their current FY than anytime in their 94 year history. Here's a link......
http://www.autoblog.com/2014/04/25/mazda-record-profits-highest-94-years/"
ab348,May-14,"The Mazda is a nice-looking car overall but the schnozz and the overly long hood/front clip do it no favors. The interior is pretty blah also. Auto journalists love Mazda, but the buying public does not seem to share that view."
[Deleted User],May-14,"Man I don't have a clue on the 6. I am starting to see more of the 3 (which I can barely tell apart except in overall length). As I mentioned before my neighbor bought a 3, with black/black color ""scheme"". Might as well put Darth Vader sound effects through the stereo (of his ship, not the asthma breathing thing)
When I do see them on the road, they don't really do it for me except in red. Could it be just that? Wrong colors? Or is it that America isn't quite sure about Mazda? I really, honestly have no idea.
I can tell you one thing about the CX-5. Ugly from the back. I was really surprised, because the rest of it is a good looking CUV."
stickguy,May-14,"speaking of dealers, last week I did a road trip from Jersey to S. Carolina (down 95), then back up through Charlotte and down 85 back up north. It seemed like every other exit on 95, and a couple places off 77 (rock hill for one) had a massive Honda dealer right off the exit, easily viewable from the highway. Must be popular in the Carolinas!"
Michaell,May-14,I'm sure half of them are owned by Rick Hendrick.
plekto,May-14,One wonders how much the sales would fall if rental and fleet sales were removed from the equation.
backy,May-14,"My guess is that the Accord would by far lead in terms of retail sales, and for a few cars like the Mazda6 and Legacy the numbers wouldn't change much. And I bet most of the Avengers went to fleets--pretty cheap for a mid-sized car (or ""full size"" car as some rental companies like to call mid-sized cars).
One thing that's usually overlooked is that when Hyundai/Kia is considered as a whole, its mid-sized sales are near the top of the charts... in this case, 2nd behind the Camry."
akirby,May-14,Fleet sales are good if managed properly. Even rental sales. The key is not to fleet dump - overproducing and selling them to fleets at bargain prices or super cheap models and flooding the used car market.
allez,May-14,"$4k difference between price I was offered for a Mazda 6 GT with Tech package vs Honda Accord EX-L/Nav. Mazda wouldn't come down in price, so I got the Honda."
m6user,May-14,"Maybe that is the way Mazda is making record profits.....not discounting as much. Probably, among other reasons I already mentioned, the 6 is not seen as much. I've seen many advertisements in the Chicago area for new Camry LEs at over $5500 off MSRP. I've seen a couple of ads for Avengers at over $6000 off. I don't see many ads at all for Mazda so either their marketing help to dealers is very small or the dealers are selling enough to make good profit without ""blowing them out""."
robr2,May-14,Mazda profit this past year came from the weak yen and they have stated that profits will fall as the yen gets stronger versus currencies from emerging markets.
allez,May-14,"Not discounting much would make more sense if you had great sales numbers, but according to the April numbers above that's not been the case; instead, they may be losing customers because of their prices."
backy,May-14,"If Mazda is selling all the Mazda6's they want to sell and are making good profits on them, they have no incentive to add incentives. I figure if Mazda were not selling as many Mazda6's as they'd like, we'd see bigger incentives.
Conversely, Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Ford, Chevy, Hyundai et. al. need to pile on incentives in order to keep sales up and keep their factories busy, and in some cases to clear out old models e.g. 2014 Sonatas."
ab348,May-14,You aren't making great profits selling 3000-4000 midsize cars a month when the competition is selling 10 times as many. Remember their N.A. management said last year they were trying to premiumize the brand by charging more than the rest to give it a more upscale image. How's that working out for ya?
m6user,May-14,How is what working out for me? I don't think you have clue how many they have to sell to make a good profit. It's all relative to the scale of the company. I never read or heard anything about Mazda wanting to go upscale to charge more. Maybe you supply some info.

I don't think you have clue how many they have to sell to make a good profit. It's all relative to the scale of the company. I never read or heard anything about Mazda wanting to go upscale to charge more. Maybe you supply some info.

The money quote from that last item: ""That’s how we aim to be like a premium…Broadly speaking, it is not to rely on discounts but to have consumers appreciate the value of the product.”"
[Deleted User],May-14,".I read some of the URL's above. One of them was Mazda's goal of increasing (mid size) sales 43% by 2016.
Sales of the 6 are exactly the same now as with the last model! Mazda can't be happy about this. .
stickguy: Cool! Road trip from N J down to SC on 95? How was the drive and what car did you take?"
m6user,May-14,"If anyone bothered took at the link I provided it explained that Mazda has done much better in the UK, Europe and Asia then in the US. Gee, we aren't even through half of 2014 and you are already counting them out for a forecast for two years from now. Funny how nobody mentions Subaru needing more sales. Unless one really knows the balance sheet, it's really difficult to say how a company is doing by looking at one model in one country. In fact, it's kind of silly to do so. I have no vested interest in Mazda but do like the brand and what they try to do. So I like to stick up for the little guy some I guess."
stickguy,May-14,"It was a big loop. Jersey (philly burbs) to Williamsburg VA (4.5 hours) and stayed there overnight. from there to Columbia SC (about 6 hours), stayed overnight. Toured in the AM, then drove to Burlington NC. only 3 hours. 2 days there, and then 7 hours back to NJ.
We took the wife's RDX. Only car I own that I am willing to take on a long road trip."
[Deleted User],May-14,"I like the RDX. For some reason C/D liked the previous Turbo model better, but it is the perfect long road trip vehicle. I bet the 3.5 is quieter and has smoother power delivery than the outgoing turbo model. The only car I have driven with Acura 3.5 is the Odyssey, but even then, I noticed how refined it sounded verses my wires Windstar.... which I guess isn't hard to do."
stickguy,May-14,"I never drove the turbo, but the new one, from everything I read, is vastly more refined. also a bit quicker, and much better MPG. Only thing it really needs for long road tripping is a bigger gas tank. 16 gals is just too small."
[Deleted User],May-14,"We don't talk about how any of the other brands are doing ink Europe. When benjaminh posts the figures we talk about it. Mazda has a #1 rated mid size offering with second to last place sales. I am a huge fan of the new Mazda, and I think they have a great three car lineup that challenges the very best the industry has to offer. That's why it is discussed. Mazda is relevant with very strong offerings
No one singles out Subaru because they have not made any effort or statements about wanting to change their position in the market, and they serve a niche customer. The car mag's don't even bother to include the Legacy in any comparo' s...it's not really relevant. I wouldn't take it personally. It's a compliment that people care about how Mazda is doing.
Stickguy: 16 gallons? That is small for your application, Mine is 18.5. Trust me, I need all of it"
m6user,May-14,"It just doesn't make sense to talk about a companies profit or lack of based on one little slice of the pie. I really don't care one way or the other but people making statements about overall financial status of a company without consideration of how they do in the rest of world is naive. And who made up the rule about what we talk about here? VW's sales in the US are down and only a very small portion of their overall sales and I think most people can comprehend that. I guess some people must think Mazdas are only sold in the US.

I'm nor sure but I think Mazda is a huge seller in Canada."
backy,May-14,"I think that's because the current Legacy has been around for several years. I think we'll see the all-new 2015 Legacy in comparos very soon. Looks on paper to be a nice update to the current car, with some class-leading features--including the only car in this class to offer AWD standard. Notably, FE is way up... now 36 mpg EPA highway.
Should be some interesting comparos soon, with the new 200, Legacy, and Sonata and updated Camry battling the Accord, Mazda6 et. al.
http://www.subaru.com/2015-legacy.html"
stickguy,May-14,"this really is the sweet spot of the market now, with fantastic products. you also get lots of room and near compact FE, for barely more than compact money. I tend to like smaller cars, but if I was buying new now, would probably go midsized after all. Especially if I was looking to use it for highway trips."
ab348,May-14,"They do OK with the 3, although it is also struggling with pricing here. They cannot give the 6 away though, it is just not selling at all. The Mazda 3 is the #9-ranked selling car in Canada, although its sales are down from a year ago. The Mazda 6 is ranked an incredible #115 in sales, down 56% from a year ago. It must be a huge disappointment for them.

We recently had an event that included a couple of new subarus on display. Although 2014, they were loaded to the max. I got in the outback and the other ""sporty one"" whose name I don't recall. The cars looked great! Unfortunately, on opening the doors to each of them it looked like the guys from Toyota selected the interior materials for them - cheap, hard, shiny plastic. With decent interior materials I may actually consider one, but I don't need, nor will I buy, another car with such a cheap interior. FWIW, in my opinion that is Mazda's problem with the 6 as well. The car is stunning..... until you open the door."

The sporty one is the WRX"
[Deleted User],May-14,The sporty on is the WRX. It is considered a compact sedan... but still not excuse for shiny plastic in a modern car costing $30k +
wayne21,May-14,"I could not agree more! But I guess subaru is a different niche and they get away with whatever interior they want to put in a car. I don't know how Toyota gets away with it (even the nearly $40k venza is full of cheap, hard, shiny, misfitting plastic) or how/why mazda would think the mazda 6 was an ""upscale"" car with all the cheap, hard, shiny plastic it has. I'm sure the fanboys of those two companies will live in denial and come to their rescue stating what fine interior materials they have, but that's not reality."
suydam,May-14,Interesting that most of the reviews of the new 6 have mentioned how nice the interior is. Edmunds for example. Main criticism is the touchscreen interface.
ab348,May-14,"The reviews I have read have been decidedly mixed. While some were favorable towards the materials, others criticized them for their look (the idea that they were soft-touch but looked/felt cheap seems to be a new one) and the design for being bland. I also think that one must always temper any reviews of newly-introduced cars since auto journalists often seem to say nice things about the vehicles they get to drive on junkets to exotic locations, but later tend to be much more critical when those same vehicles are tested at their home base. One of the reasons I dropped Car & Driver years ago was precisely this effect."
mtnman1,May-14,"This has probably been discussed by you guys, but I don't spend much time reading the forums anymore. Too busy anymore. I just saw the pictures of the redesign of the 2015 Sonata. Looks very sharp. Will be very interested to see it live since 2015 will be about the time I will be looking to trade my 2009 Ford Fusion SEL. That is along with the new Fusion, the Optima, Accord, Malibu, and Camry."
explorerx4,May-14,"Temps are warming up and fuel mileage is on the rise, too. Not back to 28-29 mpg, yet. Mileage took a jump last May, so I'm hoping for the same this year."
stickguy,May-14,"based on how many 2013 Sonatas were on the lot into 2014, and supplies of 2014s right now, there are likely to be some incredible blow-out deals this summer of the 2015 comes out on time, and looks to be a real improvement.
Same thing probably with the Camry."
ab348,May-14,Funny... many of the comments I have seen on the 2015 Sonata refer to it as a return to conformity for Hyundai and a step backwards.
stickguy,May-14,"I am not that big on over-styled cars. if it looks a little more classy and traditional, while having more room and better visibility (and nicer interior) sounds like an improvement to me."
akirby,May-14,It's not the temps rising - it's the switch to summer blend gasoline.
[Deleted User],May-14,"It is a simple, functional design, much like my own. It has high quality materials, but the focus is the driving, not operating a Viper Mark 7 ."
explorerx4,May-14,"@akirby, Here in the NE, it's both temp and fuel blend."
[Deleted User],May-14,"Mazda 3 narrowly wins a 5 car comparo in C/D (June 14). Corolla in last place. Why am I posting this in mid-size? Because the Toyota, VW, and the Kia are all mid-size, according to the EPA.
5) Toyota Corolla S
4) Honda Civic EX-L
3) Kia Forte EX 2.4
2) VW Jetta SE 1.8T
1) Mazda 3i Touring 2.0
Funny how the Focus wasn't tested. It has to kill Toyota that despite the modern looking new Corolla (inside and out) that it still came in last. I was surprised too, TBO."
backy,May-14,"Focus wasn't tested because C/D tends to take the previous winner + new/changed cars for its comparos.
Also MT did a similar comparo this month, but they invited the Focus plus 7 other cars. Apparently, Ford couldn't provide a Focus (??), and the Dart and Jetta finished so low in the comparo that MT wouldn't even waste paper on them--you have to go online to see the details on them! The five finalists were: 5) Elantra Limited, 4) Corolla LE Eco Plus, 3) Civic EX, 2) Forte EX, and 1) Mazda3i Touring. Interesting how the Jetta was 2nd in C/D's test and way way back in the pack in MT's. Otherwise the rankings were the same, for the cars both tested.
I guess the lesson here is, don't bring a mid-sized car to a compact car race!"
ab348,May-14,Or don't believe what the car magazines tell you. There is clearly a bias to most of their reviews.
m6user,May-14,What bias is that?
ab348,May-14,Depends on the mag. Some like handling over all else are are utterly tolerant of excessive NVH. Some are fanboys for certain makes or haters for others. Some go for the latest and greatest every time.
backy,May-14,Isn't that the idea of a comparo? To look at the latest cars in a category and say which one is the greatest?
stickguy,May-14,"C&D always skews toward handling/sporty over all else. MT, hard to know what gets them going. Both of those just came in the mail. will have to check it out. Particularly CD (a much better magazine IMO), since it includes the write up on the Jetta.
interesting enough, his final 2 choices finished 1st and 2nd. Was really hot on the 3 until the very end."
[Deleted User],May-14,"The 3 wins both comparo's! I have seen the Jetta rated all over the place. C/D rated the 2.5 SE last due to the 5 cyl, but now the 1.8T has change that, even with that same drab-gray plastic laden interior that I tire at looking at no matter how well the 'dub places. A new interior is due any day now C/D mentioned."
stickguy,May-14,a whole new jetta is due soon. expect better quality interior (materials) but no more flash or color.
stickguy,May-14,"I read the jetta write-up in C&D. Reasonable summary I think. But, they love to pick on cars with ""boring"" style, even if it is also tasteful, classy, leads to huge interior and trunk room, and good visibility. same with the interior. not everyone wants a car that looks like it was designed in japan circa 1979. By datsun.
also, they complained about the radio. The upgrade package (that we have) would remedy that problem.
Yeah, the interior is simple, if not plain, and dark. But, good quality materials. Excellent seats. Great ergonomics. IOW, the important stuff.
plus, it really shone on the driving. not quite the athlete the Mazda is, but best ride/control, solid handling, and plenty of other positives. Also the best engine/trans combo. Huge trunk. Which are probably the attributes most important to buyers.
having recently driven it 5 hours home from NY, it is a great travel car. comfy, quiet, sneaky fast, and got 37 MPG overall. hard to argue with that."
ab348,May-14,"Yeah, but nobody is buying it. Seems to me that compact buyers value a smooth quiet ride over laser-sharp handling combined with a noisy, harsh ride. But not C&D."
akirby,May-14,Every review whether it's C&D or the WSJ or a personal blog is biased to some degree. It's human nature. You really just have to look at the objective comments and see what matters to you or doesn't matter to you. The rest is just entertainment.
rbirns1,May-14,"Didn't Jetta used to be inexpensive? Seems like they're priced higher than Accord, Camry, Altima, and other cars that compete with Passat."
stickguy,May-14,Not really. No mire so than other compacts like the civic. Depending of course on engine. The TDI adds a chunk.
[Deleted User],May-14,"stickguy said: ""also, they complained about the radio"". ""The upgrade package (that we have) would remedy that problem"":
That radio really was awful. It was kind of weird looking, like they decided on size 20 font Arial Black, and only one line of LED's can be displayed at one time.
I know it is a good driving car, and if I was your son I would be jazzed about it too! I remember my first finance deal for my 87 Z24 very very fondly.
.
Your son did well to buy the 1.8T with the full independent suspension instead of the outgoing 5 cyl and the rear stick suspension. It is basically the same as the new Audi A3 base model. Speaking of which, I sure wouldn't mind driving the A3 Quattro with the 220 HP 2.0T!"
Sandman6472,May-14,"The rental version Jetta is so boring I try to avoid driving one. Have yet to get the new Mazda3 yet or even the 6 for that matter. Did drive the new Impala again yesterday and GM has hit a home run here especially with the 6 cylinder engine, really the first GM I'd consider purchasing if we needed a larger vehicle.
The Sandman"
explorerx4,May-14,"I took a look under a Jetta GLI, has IRS, and there is no comparison to the components on my Fusion. I'm sure it functions well enough, though."
[Deleted User],May-14,"Oh yeah man., at the DC auto show, there was a black Impala LTZ 3.6 with the brown/tan leather interior. It was gorgeous. . I had to wait in line to sit in it.
All the materials in it were first rate. I think it is a home run for a large sedan. Beautiful, strong lines without gimmicky styling that ends up not aging well. It will be just as beautiful in 15 years as it is today, IMHO."
ab348,May-14,"I thought I'd like the Impala a lot more than I do. It's just so damn massive. The styling is fine, it just needs to be reduced to about 85%-90% of actual size. I am not a big fan of the dash & steering wheel design inside, and I wish to hell the interiors weren't so dark, at least all the ones I have seen."
stickguy,May-14,I saw a black LTZ Impala in a parking lot this AM. it did look stylish.
[Deleted User],May-14,"Another neighbor brought home a Fusion. Black with tan cloth interior, 17"" rims, Michelins instead of the barely-a brand Nexens on mine). This one had knobs and no MFT, and I was really impressed with the materials. I asked my neighbor if it was a 1.6T, and he said yes, but I got the feeling he didn't know.
He said it was $24k with taxes and tags."
brian125,May-14,"cski,
Answer this question for me you live in VA.
If i buy a new vehicle in VA today and move 2 weeks later to another state.
Is the property tax paid on the new vehicle in Va prorated or do you pay the whole fee upfront one time??"
[Deleted User],May-14,I have never moved to another state in 2 weeks. I will check out the Dept of Taxation. You will pay the full sales tax of course.
brian125,May-14,Sorry i worded that wrong. I meant to say VA residents not me. who buy a new vehicle then move 2 weeks later to another state . Are they subject to pay the full property tax rate on that car or is it prorated. I was reading one of the state laws that was talking about prorating the tax rate on the new car purchase if you move out of state..
[Deleted User],May-14,"It's prorated for sure, but here's the thing. I would be careful to have your ducks in a row. If you try to move 2 weeks later to another state to avoid paying much higher sales tax in the other state, then both states frown upon that. Like if you bought a car here, paid sales tax, then moved to West Virginia in less than 30 days, you will then pay full sales tax in West VA too. Fun huh?
To just directly answer your question, you don't pay property tax up front here. You get billed in the fall and have to pay it or your tags will not be renewed. Years back we had to have a new sticker every year next to the inspection sticker, and the taxes were not subsidized, so my car would have been $800 the first year. Everyone hated it, so it was repealed and is now half that."
brian125,May-14,"cski,
Thanks for the info.. I actually pulled up some more of Va state laws on this matter..I'm trying to help a young lady who lives in Va. and has bought a new car yesterday but is moving to florida in a couple of weeks."
[Deleted User],May-14,"Wow. Brutal drive in to the city this morning. It was raining so hard that there were impromptu rivers crossing not only secondary roads in low spots, but even across 395 and the beltway. In the mixing bowl under the tangled web of overpasses there were waterfalls pouring down directly on cars in the middle of 395. I am amazed that there were no accidents along my route. There was one spot where it was well over a foot deep across the main 4 lane road leading to the beltway (RT644). The Scibaru FR-S rear-drive little sports car made it across, so I said a quick prayer and plowed through behind it like everyone else.
I was again very pleased with the traction I had with my Bridgestone Turanza Serenity-Plus tires. Not once did I hydroplane. I felt the water resistance, but never did I feel it was out of contact with the road. So glad I bought them. Here is a review: http://tires.about.com/od/Tire_Reviews/fr/Review-Bridgestone-Turanza-Serenity-Plus.htm"
brian125,May-14,The only bad thing I read on the Serenity plus tire was reviews claiming gas mileage dropped with these tires other than that they get really nice reviews.. I used to buy the older Bridgestone Turanza's for my Infinity i30t. Tread life and noise was bad on the older tire. The older model Turanza was a ok tire.
[Deleted User],May-14,"Ever since my 2003 Mazda Protégé' hydroplaned and bounced off several walls on I-95, I get real particular on tires that have excellent wet traction, and are available for reasonable prices. The Turanza fit the bill. I have not noticed any difference in F/E from old Nexens to the Turanaza's."
brian125,May-14,"Looks like Gm is in trouble again..
With the Goverments clean up of Gm's balance sheets with our money I think its time to pull the curtain on this company if they fall again. I like how Gm never said a word about the latest recall problems which Gm new for a couple of years now.
The latest recalls:
• 2,440,591 cars for a tail-lamp malfunction that also can disable the cruise control, traction control, electronic-stability control and panic-braking assist features. Another 194,314 are in Canada, and 68,819 were exported. Affected models are the 2004-2012 Chevrolet Malibu, 2004-2007 Chevrolet Malibu Maxx, 2005-2010 Pontiac G6 and 2007-2010 Saturn Aura.
It's also brought a shake-up in the ranks, with two top engineers leaving the company, two more suspended with pay and Boyer being appointed to oversee safety.
GM shares fell 89 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $34.00"
akirby,May-14,"Worse that that - now there is a GM powerpoint from 2008 that forbids the use of derogatory terms in reports. That includes words like ""bad"", ""defect"", ""safety"", etc. That's not a good sign and helps explain why problems may have been ignored."
ab348,May-14,"I can't see how you can see those recalls as a bad thing. The company is doing the right thing. Every manufacturer has design/quality/safety skeletons in their closet. GM just opend the door on theirs. Now we wait for Toyota, Hyundai, Ford and others to do the same.
Powerpoints from 2008 are really not very relevant to the GM of today, are they?"
brian125,May-14,"As reported these last round of recalls GM quietly told dealerships about the problems years ago. Toyota has been plagued the last few years with recall problems.
I find it quiet embarrassing that America the leaders in innovation and Tech cant make a better product than what these U.S. Car companies have been trotting out there all these years. GM / Chrysler. I think in the last 5 years there is improvement from GM and somewhat Chrysler.
I like what Gm has done with the Malibu and the Impala. The Cruze seems like a alternative to the Sentra, Corrolla or Civic.
This is just the beginning, as the electronics in cars today are extraordinarily complex. I am not sure how many computer or computer-like devices are used in modern cars today but there should be a dedicated computer for each critical group of related functions.
Meanwhile, GM was fined $35 million for its delay in the handling of the recall of 2.59 million small cars over faulty ignition switches. Who gets this money? Consider it a down payment on the $10.5 billion taxpayer loss on the GM bailout."
akirby,May-14,Recalls aren't bad if the companies are doing them immediately on their own. In this case GM swept it under the rug for years and years and years and that mindset did not change until a month ago. Now they're going through all of the stuff they knew about before but chose not to disclose and now they're disclosing them. It's good they're finally there but this is disturbing corporate behavior regardless of which company it is.
Mr_Shiftright,May-14,"Let's try to keep this topic from turning into yet another GM punching bag discussion, if we can muster the will power"
[Deleted User],May-14,"I stopped buying American cars in general because it was always ""something"" that notoriously broke or leaked the entire time I owned it. Things like alternators dying every 30k, coolant bucket leaks that you can't get to w/o removing half the engine, water leaks in the passenger compartment, trunk, taillights, headlights, oil consumption, etc.
It is really nice to have a car where it is always ""nothing"", & I hope for many more miles of the same."
backy,May-14,"Except for a well-used 1975 Vega Kammback that I bought because it was real cheap (and acted like it), I've had good luck with American vehicles--mostly Pentastar minivans, including a 1991 Dodge 4-banger I owned for 7 years that held up very well and a 1999 DGC I leased for 5 years. I would have no problem buying an American vehicle if I liked it. I almost bought a Milan a few years ago as I really liked that design and heard the reliability was good. Although I like the look of the new Fusion, I'm not sold on the interior and would likely pass on it if I were looking for a new mid-sized car. The Malibu doesn't turn me on either... nor does GM's current state of affairs. The new 200 looks pretty slick and I'd give it a try if I were looking today for a new mid-sizer, but I'm wary of buying a new design in its first year, especially one with new powertrain components e.g. the 9AT on the 200.
I took my wife's 2013 Sonata in for its free scheduled oil change yesterday. In 18 months it's needed nothing but oil changes, tire rotations, and checks. Absolutely no problems. That plus the 10+ years I've had on my 2004 Elantra GT with almost nothing but normal maintenance and repair keep Hyundai on my scope when I look for a new vehicle."
[Deleted User],May-14,"My dad had an original 1984 Dodge Caravan. A no frills model with grey cloth interior, AMFM 4 speaker stereo, air con, and the base 2.2liter 4. Acceleration was eventual....meaning you could eventually get to 60. I have to say though that it never broke down, and it was really well built.
I guess this is how I adopted the no-frills strategy to reliability. Less stuff to break."
suydam,May-14,"I had an '85 Voyager. Dead at 60,000 miles when a belt broke and the engine seized. Never again!"
akirby,May-14,Cmon guys - it's not the 80s or 90s any more. There isn't a big difference between brands any more as far as reliability. The worst ones today are better than the best ones 10 years ago.
suydam,May-14,"That is true for sure, that cars nowadays are much better made. And anecdotal evidence doesn't amount to much. Still there are still some notable reliability differences even though overall many less lemons out there!"
[Deleted User],May-14,"I agree with that statement for the most part, and I for one am proud that GM has come so far, and so quickly. The CTS is the Motortrend COY, the XTS is gorgeous, and all of you have heard me go on about the new Impala....then there is the new C/7 'vette. Beautiful.
In the end though, I want the best engineered car that delivers the most bang for my buck in an attractive package with a long warranty. In late 2011 it wasn't a Malibu, Sebring, Avenger, last gen Fusion, Pontiac G6 (code for Grand Am) etc. I think the fact that Hyundai/Kia offers 10 year, 100k powertrain warranties says a lot about their confidence in the durability of the product, and goes a long way in alleviating any fears of major mechanical breakdown."
backy,May-14,"Yes, in 2011 the Optima and Sonata were at or near the top of the heap in the mid-sized class. But soon the Optima will be the oldest of any of the mid-sized family sedans--once the new Sonata and Legacy debut. How quickly the automotive scene changes!"
akirby,May-14,Warranties mean nothing - it's simply a calculated additional cost to the mfr. When Hondas were bulletproof they only had a 3 yr warranty. When Hyundai first came out with their 10 yr warranty they were terrible. On a modern car the difference between a 3/5 yr warranty and a 10 yr warranty is probably just a few hundred dollars.
Mr_Shiftright,May-14,"yes, warranties are kind of counter-intuitive aren't they? Rationally, the best cars should have the shortest warranties."
[Deleted User],May-14,"akirby: ""warranties mean nothing""
WHAT? I can't believe you said that. You would have a defective gas tank right now if it wasn't for the warranty on your Fusion.
I had a major transmission problem with the Jeep (saved me $6000), and an engine replaced in my then 3year old Saturn SL2. Paid for with meaningless warranties!
It would be different if I drove 25 miles each way to work in light traffic in the Midwest or even down in suburban Richmond; vs. crawling along the beltway at 103 degrees for an hour each way. It is hard on the car here to say the least. My 20 mpg is a testament to that unrelenting congestion here inside the beltway. It has a major effect on cars under these conditions, causing all kinds of problems."

You missed the context. Warranties do not predict the reliability of the vehicle. The worst vehicle can have the best warranty or vice versa. A warranty is simply insurance and a longer warranty just adds a few hundred bucks to the cost of the vehicle. Longer warranty does not mean fewer problems."
suydam,May-14,"Also, warranties don't cover everything. I've never had a problem that a manufacturer warranty would cover within the time period."
stevedebi,May-14,I've had the opposite experience. I had an extended warranty on my wife's 2002 Honda Civic. It paid off when a couple of the electronic parts broke after the 3/36. I also still have one on my Ford Escape Hybrid; there is just too much to go wrong that isn't covered on the hybrid warranty. That one (although more expensive initially) has also paid for itself. That particular vehicle has some stuff that is very expensive to repair.
[Deleted User],May-14,"One of the first things a tech does when things go awry is replace the ECU. They can cost north of $2k. So, yeah electrical components can and do fail. I had the BCU replaced on the Jeep (Body Control Unit ). That was $1300. Covered!

ahightower,May-14,"'13 Accord Sport manual. Fuel economy has taken a hit recently, from about 29 to about 26, due to warmer weather and my shorter commute. I was going to try the last tank on Eco mode, as I'm interested to see if it makes a bigger difference in city driving than it did in mostly highway driving. But then I got irritated the first afternoon of my experiment as the AC wasn't going full blast. So the world may never know. I'm okay with the 10% dip in fuel economy, especially as I only fill up only every 12-14 days now. 13K in 11 months, and still love it. The Mazda3 was a good little runabout, but I'm spoiled by space and power, can't imagine downsizing."

Your biggest problem with a Chrysler vehicle is after 3 years. How is this model standing up? Is your front end shot? Are the bolts falling out of your Seats yet . Is the glove box and dash squeeking after 30k . Is your transmission acting up yet? The list goes on for Dodge/ Chrysler. If you dont plan on keeping the car for more than 4 or 5 years what is the resale on this vehicle. Has Chrysler improved gas mileage in most models.
Consumer Reports has announced its annual list of worst vehicles, a cringe-inducing contrast to its list of top vehicles. Ignominiously leading the way in 2014 is Chrysler, which has a staggering seven models listed.
Jeep nearly sweeps the small SUV segment by itself, with its Compass, Patriot and 2.4-liter version of the new Cherokee, while the only midsize sedans listed by CR were the Chrysler 200 and Dodge Avenger. The new Dodge Dart and the Dodge Journey round out CR's condemnation of Chrysler."
[Deleted User],May-14,"Oh yeah, Chrysler has been terrible, and I have little interest in buying one, especially with Fiat as a partner and in a brand new first year model, but it is the first product of the new Sterling Heights Assembly Plant after a 1 billion dollar overhaul.
Chrysler now has a world class production facility, including a fully robotic body shop, new conveyor system, world class paint shop, and a department that assures fit and finish before parts are ever assembled on the vehicle. I just want to drive a product of that new plant.
Nobody back in 2001 could have convinced me I would be driving a Kia one day, so I never say never anymore!"
brian125,May-14,"Here is some early year facts about Chrysler.
Chrysler is an international automobile manufacturer headquartered in Auburn Hills, Michigan. Chrysler was one of the ""Big Three"" American automobile manufacturers. It sells vehicles worldwide under its flagship Chrysler brand, as well as the Dodge, Jeep and Ram. Other major divisions include Mopar, its automotive parts and accessories division, and SRT, its performance automobile division. In 2014, Chrysler Group LLC is the seventh biggest automaker in the world by production.
The Chrysler Corporation was founded by Walter Chrysler in 1925, out of what remained of the Maxwell Motor Company. Chrysler greatly expanded in 1928, when it acquired the Fargo truck company and the Dodge Brothers Company and began selling vehicles under those brands; that same year it also established the Plymouth and DeSoto automobile brands."

backy,May-14,"Mags like MT and C/D rate cars on how they are to drive , not how they are to sit in. Hence cars like the Mazda6 and Accord typically do well in these comparos. Cars that are nice boulevard cruisers like the Camry and Malibu and Altima, not so much."
[Deleted User],May-14,"In the small car compare (CD June) the Focus, Elantra and the Sentra were left out, and the mid size test above left out Passat, Camry, Fusion and if we stretch it the Legacy. The Impreza used to be compared to the Mitsui Lancer exclusively, but now it appears that it is sort of in a class by itself since the pending demise of Mitsubishi in the U.S. It is also priced more like a mid size."
[Deleted User],May-14,"Sometimes my Optima is fun to drive, and others it is no fun at all. It feels unnecessarily stiff and over broken pavement and potholes it sends shockwaves through the chassis, and feels like it loses contact with the pavement. It makes me wince. However, on smooth pavement it drives really nicely until you get to corners, where I have to make constant corrections because I can't feel where the front wheels are or what they are doing.
Everything else about the car, is excellent. (well except for being able to see out of the back)."
akirby,May-14,These comparison tests are purely for entertainment purposes and really have little to do with actual buying preferences. By nature they are subjective.

Mr_Shiftright,May-14,"I was surprised the Chrysler 200 was rated as rather tepid in acceleration---soemething like 8.7 seconds, which puts it dangerously close to Prius territory (9.5 sec) . That's really not very impressive, if true."

ahightower,May-14,"Impressive showing, Kia. Especially considering it's the oldest platform in the group, IIRC.

We can all find some periodical who will support our allegiance to what we actually bought. There doesn't appear to be a terrible choice available.
Plus let's consider actual transaction cost - no doubt the heavy discounts on outgoing upper-level Optimas later this year would have pushed that value equation way into first place. At which point they would complain about its impending replacement and exclude it from the test, as they did with the Sonata... Bottom line - take even professionals' opinions with a huge grain of salt. Use them to gather your facts and prepare for your own analysis, and then go out and actually experience everything for yourself. And then become a forum fanboy,"

C/D also said that the Accord Sport was ""the best value in the US"". They were pining for more options with the M/T version,( as usual) but not slamming the Sport in general.
However, 6 months later they said in a long term fleet update that no one had taken the car out to do anything sporting and it was relegated to more plebian use.
I would drive the Mazda first, Accord second, and the Fusion/Optima tied for third and fourth before making a decision if I was in the market for a midsize today.
I would not include the 200C or S unless it was the second year of production and it had a good track record. The Passat is well built even if styled after a potato, but I have noted that it costs almost double the cost to own compared to most of the others. Also, it is underpowered with the new 1.8 turbo, even though ditching the antique 5cyl 2.5 motor."
akirby,May-14,If you took 6 vehicles and asked 100 people to rank them you'd get 20 or 30 different rankings (at least). It's far too subjective to be meaningful and everyone is biased to one degree or another.
brian125,May-14,"Agreed. 70 people out of that 100 may have never owned a midsize car before. what could they possible know? A first time buyer in any field has no clue especially comming from used vehicles or a compact car.
I find consumer reports to be the best out of the lot on reviews. They all have there hidden agenda's but overall Consumer reports is on point. Motor Trend, Car and driver are laughable at times with some of there reviews.
There is a poster in our forums cant think of his name.. He works at a Car rental place and drives cars back and forth in S. Florida. I enjoy reading some of his reviews on the little cars/ midsize cars. We should get him side work at Motor trend or Car and driver. He would be a welcome addition not a 2 hour test drive guy reporting..
I always find a good indicator with people reviews are repair records on there vehicle. Ride, design, handling, comfort you need to take there reviews with a grain of salt.

He left a Corvette with one mile on it sit out and rust. I would have liked to punch him in the face.

""The Honda Accord nails the fundamentals like no other car. It’s spacious, fuel efficient, reliable, and has excellent outward visibility. No wonder it’s so popular. In the hypercompetitive midsize sedan segment, the Accord stands out for its refined powertrains, its ergonomics, and its overall attention to detail. The fact that it can be equipped with one of the best, slickest-shifting manual transmissions in the world and handles like a smaller car is a bonus.""

I would honestly drive the Mazda first, but I have a feeling it would be $5000 more for the features I would want. I am pretty sure I would be bringing the Accord home."

Before I am ready to buy something like this, I am going to need a few first hand accounts of how they work and if they are really worth it.

BC racing and the Megans are both made in Taiwan. Both fit your kia. Either one will be an improvement with megans costing a few dollars cheaper. Quality and noise have been a problem with some of the Megan coils. Thats why alot of folks choose the BC.
I believe both brands have height adjustments front/ back.
If you want my opinion buy which ever one is cheaper. Both good coils and you will notice better ride quality in your Kia........... Money well spent."
[Deleted User],May-14,"Hey brian125 -
Sounds like you know what you are talking about. Any personal experience with coil-overs?
I was actually looking at the next step up too, as $900 is not a huge stretch from $700, and it has twice the settings. However, other than adjustable ride height, I have no idea what the rest of the features do for me. I just want to tighten it up a little, and when the wheel rebounds from broken pavement, bumps, and holes, it doesn't make me cringe. I think Kia tried to do just that, but they cut corners on the quality of the struts and shocks. Places that BMW, Audi, and even Mazda and Honda does not.
Yeah, I have an itchy trigger finger on the Visa.... just need to find out how much installation is, and if it will affect my warranty in any way. It would be perfect if I could get them for 6 month same as cash. Who wants to pay interest?
Anyway, check these out! http://www.k5optimastore.com/collections/coilovers/products/megan-racing-coilovers-street-series"

Will track down my Son tommorrow and shoot you a IM on Coils. He has used the BC racing/ Megan coils on a few of his cars. Check Kia forums if someone has used the megans and think they are good save the few hundred and go with megans over BC- racing. Friends i know who used megans have no complaints."
[Deleted User],May-14,"Thanks Brian. Did he pop them on himself, or pay a local shop? If he paid, Pl, ease let me know how much he paid."
brian125,May-14,"cski, posted on your wall
My son said get the BC racing coil overs. They are better made last longer and quiet. Worth the extra $$............ Both made from same company. The Megans & BCs are very similar, except in the following regards. The Megans have pillow ball front and rear mounts, while the BC just have in front. Son thinks a pillowball rear is overkill. Does not make a bigger difference. Both have height and dampening adjustment. Both have camber plates in front.
Now, the main difference with the BCs is that they have a larger diameter shock body which has a lot of advantages, especially ride and durability. So, it comes down to price, all are similarly priced. But the BC really seem to be better built and a more complete package. My son said get the BCs. He installed them with his friend it was not hard.
I would find a house mechanic who does work on the side. $75 a side is probably the going rate.
Check out : Import image racing my son said there are other goodies you could replace on your kia that will Improve your suspension when the time come
My take on both coil overs would be for light street driving and cornering the Megans should do the job fine but with more agressive driving you might want to spend the extra for the BC's or just buy the best and dont look back.
Stay away from the Teins coilovers"
mtnman1,May-14,I agree. I would consider my first ever Honda if they would include these on the sport. I can't get buy without Sirius Radio. We currently own a 2009 Fusion and a 2012 Highlander Limited both with active Sirius radio. I have renewed my Fuison SEL 6 times since I bought it in October of 2008. I do quite a bit of driving as a Manufacturer Rep so I could not live without it. I love my Fusion and will be looking to buy a new car in a year. Fusion Titanium and Optima SXL will top my list. Chevy Malibu and the 2015 redesigned Sonata will be next followed by the Accord. I have always had an aversion to Honda since most of the owners I know seem to be Liberal in their politics. My Sister and her husband are fanatical Liberals and have only owned one non Honda in their 30 years together. They won't even look at another brand. I always tell them to have an open mind about buying a car you might be suprised.

That seems to be the reason people switched to s/CUVs is because of the image of the minivan, not the practicality, the minivan ( or even further back the station wagon) has lost sales because it became popular and has an image problem now. It is the image of who drives one that has lead to the sales drop."

But they want the SUV do to it's more adventurous appearance or something like that.
Why do people want dual exhaust when in modern day cars it adds not one iota of performance in 99.9% of cases? They want to look cooler because they think their car looks cooler. Nothing wrong with it, it's just human nature but to deny it is being naive.
As far as a survey......how about common sense."
ivan_99,May-14,Agreed...I can't wait to get rid of my mini-van. It seems the advantages aren't that much greater than the 'cool' SUV's; especially mileage. But your analysis is correct...mostly because it looks like a big dorky vehicle...
[Deleted User],May-14,"Also, many of the SUV's that were a macho alternative to minivans have been neutered, like the New Nissan Mallfinder which is no longer a body on frame, real 4X4 with a low range transfer case. Same with the new MDX. They even killed off the dual exhaust, then stuck rectangular chrome framed reflectors exactly where the tips should be, and even though it has better performance out of a smaller engine, it is no longer cool."

I can only speak from personal experience but my wife has liked SUVs and CUVs for over 20 years. She likes the styling of some suvs and cuvs (mostly Fords) and she despises the styling of all minivans regardless of who drives them or why. What other people think about what we drive has no bearing on our choices. We drive what we like - period. And I think the majority of people do the same when choosing a cuv/suv over a minivan. How many people who drive minivans continue driving minivans when their kids grow up? Very few I bet."

Or maybe they just prefer the styling on the suv rather than the ugly minivan. Unless you need seating for 7 a midsized cuv or suv will provide the same utility for most folks but with more attractive styling.
Why do people want dual exhaust when in modern day cars it adds not one iota of performance in 99.9% of cases? They want to look cooler because they think their car looks cooler. Nothing wrong with it, it's just human nature but to deny it is being naive.
Because it looks better. Not because it makes people think differently about the driver."
nyccarguy,May-14,"I'll throw my hat into the minivan vs. SUV spin off discussion here. A little over 3 years ago, we expanded our family by having a 3rd child. My wife's 2010 TSX wasn't going to ""cut the mustard"" with 3 kids in car seats. I'm not going to lie. We both looked at one another and said: ""We don't want a minivan."" Practically speaking we could certainly use the space and versatility. Besides interior space, our other requirement was that the vehicle had 4WD or AWD. Well, I didn't really want a minivan to begin with and I sure as salt wasn't going to spend over $40K on an AWD Sienna. So we went with an SUV. 3 years and close to 50K miles later, we're happy. SUVs certainly aren't any ""cooler"" than minivans. Around me, Pilots are just as ubiquitous as Odysseys.
Just to keep this on topic, I am looking at a few Mid-Sizers for when the lease is up on my 2011 328xi this coming September. I'll be checking out the Passat TSI, the Passat TDI, the Legacy, the Altima, & the Accord EX. I'll keep you posted on my test drives and experiences."
stickguy,May-14,"Dang, that sounds like fun. maybe I should meet you in Rockland after work on a Saturday, and go on a test drive binge?"
nyccarguy,May-14,"@stickguy‌
Ha! That would be hilarious! We'll try the old ""HEY! MY BUDDY HERE WANTS TO BUY A CAR TODAY. WHO WANTS TO SELL HIM ONE?"" routine.
Don't laugh, but I have found in the past that cars are somewhat cheaper in Rockland. In CT, we've got the dreaded ""Conveyance Fee"" of anywhere from $199 to $499 so it is just one less layer of BS to negotiate through. I have no problem travelling to Westchester, Rockland, or even Long Island to get a good deal on a car. 2 of the 3 cars in my fleet are from Rockalnd (Prelude & BMW).
I'm going to test drive closer to home though & always give the ""hometown dealer"" a last chance to earn my business. There is a VW dealer & a Subaru dealer in Stamford. Nissan is in Darien (next town up on 95). Honda is in Greenwich (where I bought my Pilot) or Westport (where we service our Pilot)."

akirby,May-14,"And since when are SUVs and CUVs ""cool"" or ""status vehicles""? They're neither exclusive nor prestigious."
brian125,May-14,"Exactly my point.............. You look no cooler in a Suv, or minivan with 3 kids. To me if your driven a Sequoia or a Pilot , etc does not make you look more hip than a minivan owner..
Thats my view"
dudleyr,May-14,"A minivan is just about the only vehicle that seats 5 (or 6) adults comfortably on a long trip. 3 Accross in one row is tight even in a Suburban (at least with three large sons). The minivans have a useable third row seat. No SUV has that - not even that Suburban. The third row is cramped and your knees are up in your chest.
My wife's Sienna seats 6 in stretched out comfort. The minivan is not mini anymore. My oldest son goes to college in the fall, and we will probably replace the Sienna. My wife still wants a hatch/wagon/van for shopping trips (furniture etc). The problem is that if you get something with good room for her and 3 six footers you leave out crossovers like the CRV and have to move up to a Venza or Highlander sized vehicle. If you are there you might as well get an Odyssey as it is cheaper, gets better mpg and has much more room. So we may wind up with another minivan for lack of a better choice.
Wish they still made a nice sized wagon like the Accord or Camry. I know the Venza is sort of a Camry wagon, but the Camry gets 35 mpg highway and the venza gets 25. Crosstour fares better in mpg compared to the Accord, but it is not a true wagon.
A little off topic, but these vehicles are based on sedans."

And about dual exhaust......
akirby said: ""Because it looks better. Not because it makes people think differently about the driver.""
How a vehicle looks is very subjective I agree but you are only looking at the symptom and not the underlying ""disease"". Why do they think they look better is a better question? SUVs/CUVs are not beautiful vehicles by any means. They look different than vans but not necessarily better. They are still pretty ugly when it comes right down to it. I really don't think dual exhaust looks inherently better either. In fact, many very expensive, good looking cars have single or hidden exhaust. Dual exhaust looked great on on 1960s/70s muscle cars(and some of their current throwback lookalikes) where they actually served a purpose but on an I4 just to split the exhaust pipe at the rear of the car to make it look faster or cooler is kind of funny in a way. I have a Mazda6 that has dual exhaust and could easily do without it and actually think it would look better without it. My RDX has hidden exhaust and I like it just fine. I can understand the statement ""it looks better"" but that is strictly a personal opinion, not fact."
ab348,May-14,"Given the disdain for minivans, I wonder why station wagons haven't made a comeback."
brian125,May-14,Remember Chevy Chase in the movie Vacation.. Is that the wagon your talking about.
akirby,May-14,"There is no reason for crossovers and suvs to be selling so well other than people like the styling. It's that simple. We just bought a 2014 Escape and I think it looks great. As do most of the small crossovers and suvs. We bought our first Explorer back in 93 - great looking vehicle to this day.
Just because you don't find them attractive doesn't mean that everyone else feels the same way. If that was true then CUVs and SUVs wouldn't be selling so well.
OTOH - I don't know anyone who things a minivan looks good. They're just appliances. Some are less bad than others."

akirby,May-14,But neither of those compare to an awesome midsized sedan! (back on topic - sorry)
explorerx4,May-14,"My Fusion is highly styled. To me it means there was thought put into the design. There are lots of design/functional touches that are subtle. Do they all work? Not for me, but I can see a decision made that was not just driven by cost."
backy,May-14,"Well, now you know one. I always liked the styling of the 2001-7 Pentastar vans. (The 2007 T&C was my last minivan.) And the first-gen Previa was pretty cool looking IMO. Others... not so much.
They are appliances. But appliances with seats that magically fold into the floor! Maybe the best feature of any vehicle, ever."
[Deleted User],May-14,"What minivans were originally is an alternative to the ""decidedly uncool"" station wagons. Like the 1970 Chrysler T&C my father had, green with wood sides and the rear facing jump-seats that I loved as a kid. It was the perfect family mobile, but as such it was shunned by anyone who thought they were cool...and that ""uncoolness"" trickled down to the masses. No one wants to be uncool. Even dads that mow the lawn in black socks and shorts don't want to be uncool.
Now the minivan is seen the same way. I never stopped thinking wagons were great. I loved my Mazda 6 Sportwagon. Loaded and in jet black there was no way it wasn't cool. It just depends on the car and the fickle consumer in the end. All the cool euro wagons cost a fortune, and the only alternative here was the Dodge Magnum. I didn't like it or the Charger it was based on. It looked ghetto cheap. (The 2011 and up re-skinned Charger looks great though, and is quite fast with the V8).
A Kia was never a cool car. I can't believe the brand survived, and I scoffed at them knowing I would never buy one, but here I am. If it wasn't based on the Sonata, I would have walked away; but I am sure glad I didn't."

The first year for the Caravan was 1984."
robr2,May-14,One reason for the popularity of CUV's is the aging of the American population. The higher seating position allows for the proper hip point for older folks to enter and exit the vehicle.

brian125,May-14,"CR Reports just slap down the Honda Accords hybrid claim of getting 47 mpg. CR claim is only 40 mpg. They found similar finding with Ford and Hyundai awhile back.
The Ford Fusion seems to be on the top of alot of lists for best car/ hybrid version.
Here is CR take on gas mileage tests.
In its own test of the 2014 Honda Accord Hybrid, found that the gas electric model – priced from $29,155 to $34,905 — averaged just 40 mpg in the EPA Combined cycle, a full 7 miles per gallon below the figure on its Monroney, or window, sticker.
In our testing, hybrids generally get some of the best overall gas mileage in their classes, led by models such as the Toyota Prius (44 mpg) and hybrid versions of the Honda Civic (40), Ford Fusion (39), and Toy­ota Camry (38). But an owner expecting to get the same mpg shown on the window sticker and in advertising for some of the cars might be disappointed.
Of the hybrids we’ve recently tested, 55 percent fell short of their EPA combined city/highway estimates by 10 percent or more, with hybrids built by Ford showing the largest discrepancies.
At 34 mpg overall, the Lincoln MKZ Hybrid is invitingly thrifty. But it gets 11 mpg less, or 24 percent lower, than its 45-mpg EPA figure. The C-Max and Fusion hybrids fall 10 and 8 mpg, respectively, below their advertised 47 mpg. Similarly, the Volkswagen Jetta Hybrid also falls 8 mpg short."
stickguy,May-14,not Ford's problem. Blame the EPA. they designed very specific test parameters the makers have to follow. CR should spend a billion $s on the equipment and run the same tests before they complain.

As a car guy I really admire the turbo SX Optima with it's 74 extra ponies and similar boost in torque.

explorerx4,May-14,"Geographically, I'm close to CR. CT has lots of hills and cold weather, neither of which are conducive to getting max mileage from a Hybrid.
My Fusion 2.0 turbo is rated at 26 mpg combined. I'm averaging 27.5, so far. Winter mileage is 24.5 to 25.5. Now that the weather has warmed up, mileage is sitting close to 29 mpg.
If I had to do it over again, I'd get a Hybrid SE, about the same money as I paid. Don't need all the power of the 2.0 Turbo."
scwmcan,May-14,Isn't this the Top Gear electric car/ hybrid? If it isn't it is pretty close to an exact clone
akirby,May-14,"Simple explanation - CRs test is totally different than the EPA test and hybrids don't do as well. You have to really adjust your driving habits for hybrids to get max mpg. Add in cold weather, short trips, E-10 vs. E-0 and it's easy to see how some including CR can get much lower mpg."

Truth to be told, I almost bought it instead of my Mustang.(another amazing value for the money, btw) And, yes, the SE can be had with a manual transmission if you want, which utterly transforms the car from a grocery getter to something that feels, well, a lot like a Volvo S60.(since they share a lot of DNA, after all)

It looks too narrow for its length, and the interior is too much like every other Ford these days, 99% of them in all black and hence unattractive. I have heard mixed reviews on their material choices as well.

Optimas are being advertised at $8k off at one dealership in the Columbus area. Most can be seen on dealership websites with $7K off an SXL. I am not basing mine on just Ads since they can be so deceiving, but from visiting dealership websites and actual lots and speaking to real salesmen. It is a great time to need a car.

They were comparing the EX to the other sedans, and said it was the most expensive car in the test, coming in at $30,100. What? You can get a fully loaded SX-L for $32,000. The Accord Sport they tested was $24,500!! So, they compared a stripper with 18"" rims to a loaded Kia with 300 lbs of dual sunroof and other gear that most likely added even more weight then complained the Kia was slowest in the slalom. Keep in mind that the dual panoramic sunroof(s) raise the center of gravity considerably, and that compared with 17"" rims with all season radials and yeah, the Honda is quicker. Duhhh.
My EX stickered at $24,260. Add the luxury pack and the technology pack and you are at $27,500 tops. A base model Turbo starts at $26,900. All the other cars in the test were not fully loaded. Even though it came in 2nd, at 30,000 they could have got a LOT more car,"

stevedebi,Jun-14,"I have to disagree. I think the VW Passat is the best looking. I find the lines to be absolutely classic. In a few years the Ford will appear somewhat dated, but I think there is something to the VW design that is timeless.
I grant that the Ford design is better than a lot of the imports these days, but I still like the VW better...
It is a matter of opinion, of course."
scwmcan,Jun-14,"Cali, remember the mags like motor trend don't buy the cars they test, they have to test what the manufacturers lend them ( thus no fusion since ford wouldn't give them one). This can lead to over or under optioned cars in comparision tests. I am sure the panoramic roof hurt the handling, but is it enough of a difference to have improved on the Optima's already good position, probably not, as nice as the Optima is, the suspension tuning on the current model is not as good as the top models in the midsized class. I wouldn't be surprised if the next gen model moved much closer though, Hyundai and Kia are improving by leaps and bounds, really suspension and steering ( feel) seem to be the last things they need to work on to be 100%."
b25nut,Jun-14,The interior isn't bad either.
brian125,Jun-14,"I have to Agree with you Steve. I LIKE THE PASSAT LOOK. The Ford Fusion and that big open front grille is funky. Interior is nice looking in the Titanium model
On the flip side............... The Passat depreciation value is bad and realiablity issue's are still concerning on this model. With the new redesign 2015 hopefully they address some of there issue's.
So if you ask me if i had to buy one I might have to go with the Ford."
ahightower,Jun-14,"In their defense, the cars were provided by the makers. They'd probably prefer more equal specs, but take what they get. They do try to account for differences and content and price in their rankings. That said, the car actually showing up with more stuff in it is going to have an advantage because it gets to make an impression where they could only make assumptions about the others."
m6user,Jun-14,"I'm glad I don't have to buy either one. I really don't like the Fusion look as it copies Aston way too much in the front and the rear just doesn't work. They aren't bad but the Mazda6 and Accord are best looking for now from the outside IMO. I like the Optima and new 200 for interiors. The Fusion and Sonata interiors are least liked by me. Looks are not dependent on resale value or reliability so that shouldn't enter the equation besides for the fact that looks are absolutely subjective. So it's kind of silly to try and say one is the best looking because of vastly different tastes. State what you like but don't try to say ""mine is the best"". Sounds too much like bragging to me.
If you took a poll of auto writers and most consumers just based on seeing pictures I would guess the Mazda6 would come out on top. But as stated, that is a guess."
ab348,Jun-14,That can't be a Ford interior. It isn't black.
mtnman1,Jun-14,"By far the Ford Fusion Titanium with the H Spoke 19"" wheels is the best looking followed by the Optima SXL for me. I personally find the Mazda to look like a goldfish with it's odd looking front grill. Honda Accord is better looking now but I just can't get by the blandness of it yet. I like the Accord Sport but would like it more if it had Sirius Satellite available. Or I would like the EXL if it didn't look like an old man's car with it's tiny 17"" bland wheels. I like the Chevy Malibu LTZ also. I am neutral on the Altima and VW. Neither excite me or turn me off. I will look at the Mazda 6 and the Accord along with the others though when I start test driving a replacement for my 2009 Fusion next year."
b25nut,Jun-14,"I added Ford's optional interior lighting kit to the Dune interior SE. The 2013 and early 2014 Titaniums were only available with dark interiors. The Titaniums now have a Medium Ceramic option that comes with a 10-way adjustable passenger seat, the lack of which was a weakness in the earlier models (my wife's only complaint)."
m6user,Jun-14,minuteman: Why would you even have a car that you think looks like a goldfish on your short list??? Just kidding. That is what I mean about subjectivity. I don't think you are in the majority in regards to the looks of the Mazda6 however. But I also have to admit I am probably in the minority when it comes to not liking the looks of the Fusion all that well.
explorerx4,Jun-14,"The majority feels the Mazda6 is not a car worth spending any money on, based on the continual low sales numbers."
backy,Jun-14,"The majority thinks McDonald's makes the best hamburgers in the world, based on the continual high sales numbers.
Or something closer to the topic... Toyota obviously makes the best mid-sized sedan for sale in the USA in the Camry, since it continually tops the sales charts."
ab348,Jun-14,"Define the word ""best"", guys."
m6user,Jun-14,"I can't tell you what the absolute best is. Who can? Consumer Reports, MT, C&D, your cousin, etc. But, I can tell you one thing, just because a car sells in larger numbers doesn't mean it's a better car. Just a more popular one. Ie. Camry sells a ton more than Fusion, so I guess the public thinks the Fusion isn't good enough to spend their money on compared to a Camry. Those arguments are just silly and lack maturity. I guess some people on here just can't fathom that some car companies are not nearly as big as others and sell a lot less cars respectively. Subarus are known for being quite good cars and people that actually have owned them seem to love them on the most part. But, their sales numbers are tiny compared to the biggies......just like Mazda.
When I see comments like....""Mazda will never sell as many cars as Ford(insert big car company name here)"", I have to laugh and no sh$t, Sherlock."

brian125,Jun-14,"I was talking to a Dodge Avenger owner last week here in NY. Not a bad looking vehicle. I asked him why he considered this car and he quickly said I got the best price. Then started complaining about At 13k miles his dash board is rattling and ft. brakes wore out already with mostly highway miles. Dodge uses Napa parts not made to good.
Out of the 49k Camry's sold to date this year. I'm wondering how many went to fleet sales???
Here are last years facts between the Accord and Camry
Honda Motor Co. said its Accord was the best-selling car to U.S. individual customers in 2013, surpassing Toyota Motor Corp. Camry, the leader in total volume to retail and fleet buyers for a 12th consecutive year.
Americans bought 360,089 Accords last year, Honda said in a statement yesterday, citing registration data from IHS Automotive’s . Camry retail sales were 342,007 out of 408,484 total deliveries for the sedan."
mtnman1,Jun-14,"m6user I think you meant Mtnman. I have heard good things about the Mazda 6 and it has grown on me a bit. I have been the same way about the new Highlander. I own a 2012 Highlander Limited AWD V6 and at first I was so glad I bought that year because I thought the new one was awful. I still am not sure of it, but after seeing it live when I had mine in for it's 2 year service a month ago I am starting to like it. The interior is awesome and the Tech offerings are finally catching up with the competition I think. I don't think I can get a solid opinion about a vehicle until I go and sit in and drive it. I will definitely look at the Mazda along with the Accord, Fusion, Malibu, Optima, Sonata, Camry and the Altima."
explorerx4,Jun-14,"I wonder how many of those retail sales are short term leases? I saw a car carrier full of last gen Camry's. They all looked the same except color, so I'm guessing they were lease turn ins. My guess is most of the lessee's drove out in new Camry's. They have no money down leases available."
stickguy,Jun-14,"well, if I broke down and got a Camry, it would definitely be thanks to one of the super cheap, short term leases. if I could sign and drive a decently equipped LE in the $200/range for a couple of years, I can put up with driving one. maybe."
akirby,Jun-14,"Everybody does short term leases but they're still sales either way.
49K for Camry - is that a record?"
brian125,Jun-14,"Toyota Camry sales past 3 years.
May 2012..........39,571
May 2013...........39,216
May 2014...........49,584"
benjaminh,Jun-14,"Wards auto says that it wasn't quite a record:
""Counting Camry Hybrid’s 5,199 deliveries, May 2014 was the biggest month for the Toyota midsize car since August 2009, when 54,396 were sold."""
benjaminh,Jun-14,"Still, 49,584 in one month is huge. If they could keep that rate up for a whole year, and of course they can't, it would mean sales of nearly 600k. I don't think they can make that many in a year, but they can probably make more than 500,000— and maybe a lot more."
nyccarguy,Jun-14,"I think each manufacturer in this segment is trying to shed the vanilla image of their respective cars in the segment.
I happen to think Ford's adaptation of the ""Aston Martin Grill"" looks fantastic on the Fusion. They give you a choice of everything from a Hybrid to an AWD model.
On the flip side, I think the conservative yet handsome styling of the Passat works well. Especially with those split 5 spoke 18"" wheels on the SE & SEL models. The Passat also gives you some great engine choices of either their latest turbo 4 or a TDI. At one time in the not too distant past, VW offered the Passat with 4Motion AWD. Give me that coupled to the TDI and there's no competition:)"
akirby,Jun-14,A good portion of those Camry sales are pull ahead sales with folks taking advantage of clearing out the old model. That should self-correct after a couple of months. Still pretty impressive.
[Deleted User],Jun-14,"I remembered back in 1996 my father in law had a green (THE color of that time period), VR6 with a 5 speed. It was really a peppy & great driving car, and one of the main reasons I liked the same color green TDI I inherited. I drove the TDI for 3 more years, then handed it down to my niece who still drives it at college. Keeping the turbo working requires frequent 'reboot', meaning power cycling the engine from time to time-usually when you most need it.
Otherwise you have a 60hp car with 80lb of torque, which now that I think about it would be perfect for a new teenage driver. LOL."
Mr_Shiftright,Jun-14,"I think the most popular cars ending up being the ones that aren't exceptional in anything but do most things well and nothing very badly. We might call them ""inoffensive"" in every way."
[Deleted User],Jun-14,"Every review of the Mazda 6 goes on and on about its sublime handling, braking, powertrain responsiveness such as always selecting the right gear when it is needed. This plus a really nice body puts the 6 on top of most reviews.
However, none of the conservative paint colors accentuate the curves of the body, the wheels are not attractive on all but the top end GT model which ""rewards"" its owner with a ""race tuned"" 186 HP.
Really Mazda? $30 thousand with 186 HP? I swear I heard Mazda has this ""Mazdaspeed"" team that adds turbochargers to production engines., but maybe I'm imagining things?
Next, the interior. The interior quality of the 6, with the Audi style MMI knob controlling center stack functions looks exactly the same as the 3. On the Mazda 6 however, the same Mazda 3 hard plastic abounds, LED center stack displays are tiny, look cheap, and the overall layout is not up to par with many competitors.
All this for over $30,000.
Listen up Mazda: Fix the interior, boost the 2.5 just 10 psi to 245 hp, and you have one heck of a great car. Until then, I am installing coilovers and a strut tower brace to experience the suspension improvements that come standard on the Mazda 6. The 6 is a great car. Just fix up the interior Mazda!"
Michaell,Jun-14,"I don't think Mazda has the resources to do what you suggest, now that they are independent from Ford.
The only thing Mazda is missing is a more powerful engine option - Chrysler, Honda and Nissan have both 4-cyl and 6-cyl engines. Chevrolet, Hyundai and Kia have NA and turbo 4-cyl engines. Mazda only has the one."
[Deleted User],Jun-14,"""we might call them ""inoffensive"" in every way""
Well, normally we just call them ""Camry""."
m6user,Jun-14,"@cski: Well, since you offered the rant on the Mazda6, I'll just respond somewhat.
I agree with you on the interior being less tech and sharp and in need of upgrade.. However the quality of materials I don't think are any better or worse than the rest of the competition. The interior is really much different than the new 3 which I actually prefer. I think the 6 will get upgraded to be more like the 3 uplevel dash layout when the 6 is tweaked.
The Accord EX-L I4 with a CVT is $29040. The Mazda6 Grand Touring with a 6spd auto is $30,490. I also agree that Mazda, being the lesser known, should be closer to that figure but Mazda has included a lot of equipment that is simple not on and/or unavailable on the EX-L 4 cyl. Whether it is worth the extra $1400 is in the eye of the beholder I guess.
Things that are standard on the 6 Grand Touring that are not on the Accord EX-L.
Bose 11 speaker system,
Navigation,
Directional adaptive headlights,
Blind spot sensor(although the Honda has the passenger side camera),
Auto dimming driver mirror,
Spoiler,
Rain Sensing wipers
As to mechanicals, the Mazda and the Honda are very, very close. The HP is about the same but the Mazda reaches peak at a much lower RPM which is usually preferable. The Mazda has more torque which again reaches peak at much lower RPM than the Honda. The Mazda has a longer wheelbase and shorter turn radius which are usually both postive in ride and handling.
Again, I think the Mazda would do well to be closer in price to the EX-L and still offer the above equipment to be more competitive but it isn't way overpriced considering what you get. I would venture to guess that street prices for the Mazda are more in line with EX-L street prices but with quite a bit more equipment.
I think the Mazda6 Grand Touring equipment wise is more in line with the Accord Touring, so in effect one is paying $4k more for the Accord Touring to get the V6.
On the subject of V6, I totally agree that Mazda should do something to add some HP/Torque to compete more in that area. But as most of us(not all unfortunately) can understand, Mazda is a much smaller automobile company and can only do a few things at a time and have to concentrate on those things that offer the most bang for the buck."
ab348,Jun-14,"It isn't all that great since even the Dodge Avenger is outselling it.
I agree with most of your criticisms except you left out the claustrophobic passenger compartment. It feels tight, and visibility is severely limited by the styling, especially to the sides and rear. The interior/dash looks dated, and the power or lack thereof is a joke."
dudleyr,Jun-14,"I have an Accord, but would have been happy with the Mazda6. I did not like the equipment on the base 6 and the next step up did not have the 6MT available yet (jan of '13). So I was forced to get the Accord as I don't know how to drive an automatic.
They are both great cars, the engine on the 6 is just a tad rougher and the gearshift a little less smooth, but they are both plenty fast - 0-60 in under 7 seconds. Who cars how many hp they have, they scoot with the stick shift. To me they handled about the same as far as capability, but the 6 had a heftier feel to the steering which I do like. The 6 has a little less room in the back as well.
I think the pricing is right for both of them, but the 6 does not seem to be discounted nearly as much, so that adds about another $1,000 to the price difference. I don't think they are too expensive. There are plenty of cars costing much more that don't offer much more besides bragging rights on hp."
m6user,Jun-14,"ab348: You said the Mazda6 has a claustrophobic passenger compartment. It feels tight and the power or lack thereof is a joke.
Have you even sat in 2014 Mazda6? The interior dimensions in regards to leg, hip, head, and shoulder room are all about the same as the Accord. I think officially the Accord has 101 cu ft of passenger space versus 100 cu ft in the Mazda6. Granted it doesn't have an uplevel HP/TQ engine but the I4 power is equal to or better than just about anything in the class. I have both a Honda product and a Mazda product in the household so I'm not really biased one way or the other.
Dodge Avengers are being given away as they discontinue it and everybody knows that's the only reason it is selling well right now...not because it's a better car."
Kirstie_H,Jun-14,"That's because most buyers aren't like us - they aren't enthusiastic about their midsize sedans. They value the perception of reliability and solid build quality over just about any other factor. Or, they buy what they know because it's what they've always bought. We see the latter with some family members, who always buy GM products. It's not because they feel any particular loyalty to GM, but it's what they know, they are familiar with the dealership, and it's just what they've always bought.
Of course this is my opinion only,"
suydam,Jun-14,"Or they buy Hondas and Altimas because they are great cars, and Camry is a known quantity. Mazda just isn't as well known and has fewer dealers."
backy,Jun-14,"FWIW, there's been studies done about why people especially women are considered ""beautiful"". The women most often considered ""beautiful"" are those with what my wife calls ""blurry faces"", e.g. plain vanilla without any distinguishing features like prominent noses or chins. In other words, they do most things well and nothing very badly."
stevedebi,Jun-14,"A bit OT here, but studies have also found that most models have irregular features (one ear slightly lower, etc.) If those model photos are photoshopped so they are perfectly symmetrical, they look really strange.
But that wouldn't translate well to an automobile!"
m6user,Jun-14,"I think we should all keep in mind that the vast majority of people buying the midsize sedans we talk about here are buying them for one reason......family transportation. Dependability and economy are probably the two main factors. How they pair up with their mp3 player, 0-60 times, corner carving ability, etc have little to do with their decision. Sometimes people that post in these forums consider those kind of people, shall we say, not well informed or even stupid. They are neither usually, they just don't care that much. My wife is like that. She treats the car like a necessary evil to get her to work and back and to run her errands and to do it dependably and relatively cheaply. She doesn't really care about looks, hp, sound system or even handling all that much because she never comes close to pushing a car to it's limits. She doesn't care if the car has the highest safety ratings as long as it's in the ballpark of the norm. She's probably a pretty normal consumer of these cars.
We are the oddballs that talk and post about them all the time. She calls them my nerdy sites and she's probably right."
brian125,Jun-14,"Mazda6,
This is what I see when I look at the mazda 6 from a older baby boomers view.
Midsize car that is a cross between family car and sports car look. Just dont cut it.. This is a car I see a young man / girl driving..... Cheap looking.
I like to hear from the members over 50 who would drive this car over a Accord, Fusion etc.. Mazda is on pace to sell 13k units this year.. There is no market for this car. The mazda 3 is a different story."
m6user,Jun-14,"brian125.... Don't know where you get your numbers but maybe your eyesight is getting bad. The Mazda6 sold over 43k units in the U.S. last year and has sold over 14k thru May of this year. So where you come up with 13k for this year is beyond me. They sell more 6s than the Subaru Legacy so I guess their is no market for that either. I know you're just giving your opinion and observations but I don't know how anyone can say a car is cheap just by looking at it and forming some kind of opinion of who drives the car.
If all cars were the same it would be a pretty boring segment. I've only owned one Mazda which we still have and it has been probably the most trouble free car after 109k miles and 7 years that we have ever owned and I've owned quite a few. Something north of 40. It does drive a lot sportier than most older people might like but it suits us baby boomers just fine. Of course, I'm looking at getting a Mustang GT in the future so I guess we are not the typical baby boomers. Not sure or not if we will replace the Mazda6 with a Mazda as my wife would something a little quieter. But she likes how it drives so well the only other car we might consider from a similar drive aspect is the Accord. However, the Accord, while better than it used to be, is not the most quiet in this segment either. That's why I've doing research on several cars in the segment.
It funny that everyone thinks that unless Mazda sells 5 times as many 6s that they can't compete. Is bigger always that much better. Haven't we come to the understanding that just because something sells in huge numbers that it's not necessarily a lot better."
stickguy,Jun-14,"I'm over 50, and if I needed to buy a new car right now, and wanted a big (to me, midsize to most people!) the 6 would be high on the list of desired options."
brian125,Jun-14,The .mazda has come along way. Im not a zoom zoom fan. we test drove one 6 months ago. awful engine noise like all the mazda's. there were alot of positives on this new model
brian125,Jun-14,"What I find interesting is mazda sold a little over 5k units last month. Some of that number went to fleet sales. Alot of people claim they like the mazda6.............. but most buyers dont go for the Mazda. WHY. The new 14 mazda 6 is now in production since last Oct.. My eyesight maybe be getting worse like most folks over 50, but i'm very observant of cars and folks who drive them. Most new Mazda6's i see on the road which by the way are not many have young drivers behind the wheel. Alot of young girls. Thats why in my prior post I asked who over 40 or 50 will buy one. Stickguy wants one........................... Who owns a new one????????? Nobody in here.. WHY? Is this vehicle a Family car? or Sports car? Mazda's up against stiff competition in both fields.
5k units sold in May 2014.
Below is your answer: Why mazda can't sell this vehicle as a Family or Sports car version.
Yellow VW bug.. or Red.mazda6...................... both chick cars............ lol
Just having some light fun........................ Somebody please tell me i'm wrong.
We all no the answer why mazda has trouble selling 5k units each month
Dodge............ will give away there Avenger.......... folks price driven will bite.
Honda.. Quality, Build, and resale value.. Big business.
Toyota...heavy discounts on there Camry's and vehicles. Big business
Nissan alot of incentives/ rebates
Kia/ hyundai good product. you get alot for your money, best warranty / w piece of mind
comfort.
Ford.. comming back with alot of good vehicles. Fusion on top of the midesize class.
the list goes on"
m6user,Jun-14,Ok. You're wrong.
suydam,Jun-14,"I have owned Hondas, Nissans, and Mazdas at different points in my life. I find them generally to be great vehicles. What I buy depends on my needs at the time and which car fills that need the best. I had a small Mazda sedan years ago when we were pretty strapped for cash and it did what the Civic did for a lower price. Terrific car. I had a Mazda6 wagon about 10 years ago. Loved it. I have a Honda Accord now (from a Nissan Maxima) because the Honda had the best combination of features that mattered to me. What I buy has nothing to do with perception of makes. I look over the options, narrow down to 2 or 3, drive them, and then make a choice. What I find interesting about these discussions is particular aspects of each of these midsize sedans as they change year to year, not which is the best overall. I don't think there is one clear best car year to year."
benjaminh,Jun-14,"The new Mazda6 is a pretty impressive car, at least from what I've read. I haven't yet driven one. Imho the two top midsize cars overall are the 6 and the Accord. If I hadn't gotten the Accord and been a die-hard Honda guy, my second choice would have been the 6. I'm 49."
stickguy,Jun-14,"Mazda has pretty much always been a niche player, and sales will never approach the big guns. Which is fine. They cover the sporty drivers car market, certainly a small slice of the overall one.
I can see thinking of it as a younger persons car, but never thought of the 6 as a ""chick car""."
m6user,Jun-14,That'd be like saying the BMW 328 is a chicks car because it's a sporty sedan and a lot of younger people drive them. I do see a lot of girls driving 328s so maybe it is a chicks car. LOL.
backy,Jun-14,"Me me me!!
As for why don't I own a new Mazda6 now... I do own a Mazda6, a 2005 hatch, driven mostly by my daughter but I drive it as often as I can. Love that design. And I love the new design. Just not in the market for a mid-sized sedan now, nor in the near future. But if I were, I'd seriously consider the Sport with the 6MT. Fairly basic in equipment, but all I need.
Which goes to a previous post by m6user re why people buy mid-sized cars these days... I notice when I see ads for mid-sized cars, really ANY cars/SUVs these days, they focus more on the infotainment and other gadgets than on the driving experience. Except for Mazda ads. Which may be why Mazda doesn't sell more Mazda6's. They are for people who first and foremost love to drive. Infotainment and gadgets are secondary. Who needs INFOtainment when the car itself provides all the entertainment you need?"
brian125,Jun-14,"I'd have to disagree with you on this one. Mazda sells 3 to 6k units a month. I see mostly young people and especialy girls driven the 6. Every body and there mother seems to be leasing a 328 bmw.
Is there any kind of argument You can compare probably one of the best enrty sports cars the Bmw3 series to a mazda 6.?"
ivan_99,Jun-14,"I took it as an observable comparison. You see ""chicks"" drive the 6, I see ""chicks"" drive the 3 series. I didn't think he was comparing the vehicles...and didn't think it was a serious statement since he post-fixed it with a LOL."
m6user,Jun-14,"brian125: C'mon, get a sense of humor. The fact that all you notice driving the Mazda6 around where you live is ""chicks"" gives a very small snapshot of real estate along with a total survey of one person, you. Do you really think that is a scientific or statistically reliable sample to state as fact? Come back with some facts. We already know that your estimate of Mazda6 sales for 2014 of 13k was absolutely ridiculous. I live in a large metro area and I see more guys driving around in Mazda6. What does that mean? That a there are no chicks that buy Mazda6s in the Chicago area. Absolutely not....it means nothing. Just like your observations don't mean a whole lot either. But you try to correlate your few observations to fact.
But on the other topic of BMW, from what I've been reading the last couple of years the steering response in the 3 series has gone downhill and the Mazda6 is probably the best handling midsize sedan from a enthusiastic drivers aspect. So I guess you could compare them in that respect. But no, I'm not trying to say a Mazda6 is anything as good as a 3 series. Jeeesh."

M6
You seem to be missing my point about the mazda6. In your area the few mazda6 being sold you see guys driving. In NYC area, NJ, and in Myrtle beach S.C where i'm back and forth. The 2014 mazda's I see on the road are young people............. mostly girls. My observation and the facts on sales for this vehicle lead me to believe...... This car is not going over as the family sedan or sports car. Why not?????? Seven months into production with very nice reviews but not many folks buying them.. Even the car industry experts are scratching there heads on the low sales numbers for this vehicle.. Everyone say's they like it........... but not many are buying one yet.
My question to this forum and you M6 was : I dont think the older buyers are buying this vehicle. maybe i'm wrong............... maybe i'm right
Each month The 6 mazda sells 3 to 5k plus units. Pretty sad for a car with rating's like it has.
I still think its a chick car...........lol
My thoughts on this vehicle are and i posted a review on it months ago when my son and I test drove it. I like the mazda6. Would I buy one.... NO...... The engine we both felt was underpowered and still to loud inside car for my liking. The ride was firm but not in a bad way. seats and inside materials were nice , driving position was good. At almost 6'2 a bit small for me inside the car. Headroom was awful in this mazda at 37.5' worst in its class. Very nice 10 or 11 speaker bose system. Nice upgraded features in the mazda.. Rode and handled very well,. A very big improvement from ladder years. even alot quieter inside .. Way to go mazda.. Ride and handling at higher speeds in the 6 is alot better than my V6 exl Accord. Overall I still buy my Accord over this mazda. Accord rides better on the highway, alot quieter inside the cabin especially when you step on the gas. The v-6 accord with 280 hp is very fast. Has better safety features. The Accord has much better reliability and resale value than the mazda6.
This 6 model needs a 4cyl turbo, or 6 option. 184 hp is not cutting it for me. My son is 32 so he is young and his thoughts on this vehicle were; he liked the car but felt the need for more h/p. The 6 did not excite him. He would of preferred a manual on this vehicle. We drove the auto. My son drives the G infinity and thinks he has narrowed down his choice for next vehicle between 3 series Bmw, or Mustang.
Mazda redesign's a nice sporty looking mazda6 vehicle then powers it with 3 gerbils on a wonder wheel for the motor...........Zoom zoom...lol
I think a 4 turbo would be a game changer for this vehicle.. And buyers"
brian125,Jun-14,"@ suydams said;
narrow down to 2 or 3, drive them, and then make a choice. What I find interesting about these discussions is particular aspects of each of these midsize sedans as they change year to year, not which is the best overall. I don't think there is one clear best car year to year
..............................................................................................................................
I agree with you.............. alot of vehicle's fall short of the total package with most flip floping every year / couple of years.
Quality, Build, and resale value should be at the top of your car buying list. making the choice you like best in that group of vehicles.
I'm rooting for the Passat to have a come back.............. 2015 maybe the year.

mtnman1,Jun-14,"I can't say either way whether there are more girls than guys in the 16th largest City in the country, Columbus Ohio driving the Mazda6. My guess it's probably a 50-50 split. Who knows it could just be that when Brian125 is seeing the Mazda the Wife is using the car. I drive our Fusion 90% of the time but my wife drives it the other times. Don't know how you could arrive at that deduction. I just don't see many Mazda6 around. Probably see more Hondas than any other brand by far since Marysville is only about 15 Minutes from the Columbus City limits. I can say with a definite fact the VW Beetle is seen with about 99.99% of the drivers being women. I know there was a study done a few years back for what cars women most like to drive. I believe the Toyota Solara was one of the top ones. Especially the convertable. Also the Ford Mustang convertable was up there."
brian125,Jun-14,"your comments are acurate. The mazda 6 vehicles I see on the road are young folks more woman. Take that comment as you see written. I can't comment on what you see. But I trust what your telling me. My point is dont seem older buyers are knocking down dealership doors for this vehicle.
Ive been watching this car on the road the last 4 months. Cant figure out why i dont see more 6's and why i see more young girls driven them."

benjaminh,Jun-14,"My two Honda Accords have a trip computer. Mine are both top of the line EXLs, but I think the computer is probably standard across the line. Anyway, if asked it will tell you miles to empty.
So when you're on E you can ask it and it'll show 38 miles to empty or whatever. And so if you have a 15 mile run you can do it with confidence. It's very accurate from my experience.
The Accord also tells you when you need an oil change, counting it down ""50% oil life left, 40, 30, 20, do it!"". Very helpful feature. Also makes sure you don't waist oil if you don't need it."

benjaminh,Jun-14,"I think the second point here is incorrect. High grades of steel now available, and used by some manufacturers, allow for relatively thin A B & C roof pillars while still having greater roof crush strength than previous cars.
For instance, the pillars on my 2013 Accord seem slightly thinner than the pillars on my 2008 Accord. And yet I saw the stats at one point, and the new generation of Accord is stronger in every way that the old, including dramatically increased roof crush protection. The new Accord gets top safety marks while still having excellent visibility.
Maybe not every car maker is willing to pay for the super high grades of steel that Honda uses in the Accord, but that's their choice. Gov't regs aren't doing this. To me it's an example of you pay a little more for a Honda but it's worth it.
People who are after ""style over function,"" however, are buying a lot of these cars with thick pillars and poor visibility. And so taste and the willingness of stylists to cater to that over function is mainly what's going on imho...."

It wasn't better or worse, but it sure was different, and it DOES make you pay ultra-close attention, if you're the type of person already inclined to do so. More than simply stating it's a difference in visibility, it's a difference in having to and being able to perceive the length of your vehicle, and knowing what you can and cannot see/judge clearly in the mirrors, and making good decisions based on that knowledge."

I wonder if any of these more fuel efficient and less expensive CUVs actually have decent cargo space in the ""way back"". Ford Flex did not impress.

stickguy,Jun-14,"if you want real cargo room with 3 rows up, I think you are just about limited to a Suburban or Excursion. Because as you noted, sounds like you really need a minivan even if your wife is to embarrassed to drive one (and frankly, IMO they drive a whole lot better too!).
I think the Traverse (and siblings) are probably the best for room of the less-trucky options. But no clue if they have enough space for you (I would guess not).
so if you need the space, and insist on a FS SUV, just bite the bullet and get a Burban. Can you still find an old style 2014? At least that might be a bit cheaper!"

dudleyr,Jun-14,"Minivan is the only way to go for a useful third row seat (better than suburban). If you have to go smaller SUV, the two with the most room are the redesigned Highlander and the Nissan Pathfinder. The Pilot is also pretty good. Still wouldn't want to sit in the third row too long.
My wife is in the same boat except she has a minivan right now (Sienna), but wants something new and smaller. Problem is all the SUV's have much less room than the minivan and use more gas.
I am trying to convince her to go two row like a CRV size, since our oldest will start college in the fall,
We used to have a first gen Odyssey which was an ideal size - crazy how the minivan is so far from mini now. A mazda 5 is a nice try, but the third row is tiny - nice to drive though and inexpensive."
ahightower,Jun-14,"Right - it's about space behind the third row. Most seem to have decent passenger room, but look barely able to hold a week's worth of groceries with all seats in place. (Split folding third row helps, could have at least half of the back row in play.)
We saw a Traverse. Nice ride, decent space (shallow, but wider than most), some chintzy materials. Lease quote on an LTZ was fairly high, Acadia has all the kit we need for less $. Or, could get an MDX or QX60 for about the same price... Durango rode a little too harsh and was a bit tight on space. Going to see a Pathfinder at lunch today. Santa Fe looks to be a good value, but cargo space in the way back is limited per some reviews, might see in person though just for kicks.
And with that, I'll carry on the convo in the appropriate forum. Thanks!"
[Deleted User],Jun-14,"When my kids were very young (4 to 8 yrs), they used to fight over the third row seat in our van.

The rear seats were never re-installed until the dealer made me before we traded it.
Third row seats are about as useful as a two sided spatula. They weigh at least 75 pounds and you will be lugging that around...killing your F/E."

m6user,Jun-14,"I was reading an article on Torque News about the 2015 Camry and why the 2014 Camry is still a great seller. In the comment section someone mentioned about how Honda doesn't do a lot of fleet sales and it sells more Accords to actual people than the Camry. The writer of the article had heard this in the past but it seems nobody can prove it! A portion of his response follows.....
""I did ""Google it"" hoping to find a source, but cannot. At times in the past the Accord's sales to private parties have been higher than Camry's. Historically, the Camry has sold about 15% of its cars to fleets, and fleet sales made up roughly 2% of the Accord's US sales. If that is still the case, the Camry is ahead of the Accord right now. The May sales numbers for both are in the story. The Camry is ahead by about 20%. I did the math and YTD the Camry still looks like the winner. If you have a source for both Camry and Accord fleet sales for May and YTD, paste a link here and I will take a closer look. I am a big fan of the Accord (I've owned 2), as is our Honda reporter. We'd love to do a story saying Accord is the car more families chose, but the facts we have to work with don't support that right now.""
I found it interesting and have no ax to grind with either car. In fact, I presently own a Toyota, Honda and Mazda products and like them all. It appears that once in a while the Accord may outsell to actual consumers but just as often or more the Camry outsells to consumers based on each manufacturers history of fleet sales. I have heard the argument so many times stated as fact but really never asked anybody to provide actual facts to back it up."
robr2,Jun-14,Not in all cases. I was pleasantly surprised to find that my 2011 Explorer gets about 20 mpg versus the 17 that my 2000 Odyssey got.

On the small SUV thread--that will probably be my wife's next vehicle, she needs a taller entry/exit than a sedan.

I don't care how ""popular"" a car is. I care about how it meets my needs, including budget.

ahightower,Jun-14,"Update: We got a new Nissan Mallfinder Pathfinder last night, to replace our 2005 Yukon XL.
We decided it was large enough for us. The Acadia/Traverse were larger behind the third row, but the 2nd row in the Nissan is fantastic. The third row really will be occasional use only, and only half of it at that, so cargo space was not a concern. We were insisting on 2nd row buckets to have two kids in the middle and one in the back, with no seat movement necessary. But for wife and kids' daily errands, she'll have two in the 2nd row and one riding shotgun. With all of us on board for short trips, the bench is wide with lots of leg room, no problem to fit three across (as we've discovered with my Accord), and for longer trips, it is easy to access the third row. We will always have at least half of that third row available for storage. With third row completely folded, it is more than adequate. No more little kids in car seats, so it fits us fine. Under floor storage is good. Sub takes up some space, but it still easily holds all the emergency gear, umbrella, blanket, air compressor.
Materials and ride quality, and most importantly price, the Pathfinder got us a lot more content for the money vs 2nd place Acadia SLT. It's an SL Premium, Cayenne Red over Charcoal leather. Hooray for actual color. Everything but nav (don't need it) and DVD player (don't want it, we're old school like that). Proximity key, memory seat and mirrors, dual sunroofs, backup cam, heated seats front and rear. FWD with tow package. I don't need to go off road or tow, but I will put my cargo platform on the hitch now and then, and we camp several times a year. So enough ground clearance to bounce down a two-track now and then. We're in TX, so if it snows we'll be closed that day.
Reviews indicate it has less sporty handling than some other CUVs, but that is not the purpose of this vehicle. We tested a Durango and did not care for the ""trucky"" ride. Of course our Yukon was a truck, but it had a longer wheelbase and cushier ride. Traverse was comfortable, but rather floaty by comparison. Pathfinder strikes a good balance. Flex had some chintzy materials, and Escape and Pilot (and every minivan, despite my efforts) were ruled out on looks alone. The CVT is very responsive. VQ35, need I say more? It lacks the immediate torque of the Yukon, but the whole vehicle is far more refined in every way. Materials quality was far nicer than the GMs. I've seen the various reviews about CVT issues, but it seems to have been addressed this year. And it's a lease with full warranty coverage, so I'm willing to risk it.
The dealership was fantastic - no fooling around, no harassment, and very close to my office.
I'm anxious to see how fuel economy pans out. 20/26 est. versus 13/18... There's $115 a month off the top.
The Beast will be missed, but wife is pleased, so I am too. Now to go and sell the old car. Will give CarMax a shot, and then turn to my own devices if necessary.
And I have a new forum to join!"

rbirns1,Jun-14,My obese brother had a Nissan Foodfinder
akirby,Jun-14,"True. I think it's more like they want a car that they rarely see someone else driving. So a camry is definitely off the list. I just never understood being different just for the sake of being different. I just can't see myself saying ""I really wanted that Titanium Fusion in Ruby Red with the 19"" wheels but somebody else at work just got one so now I have to find something else""."
ahightower,Jun-14,"Thanks. When I got my Accord, I felt it was so nice that I couldn't imagine anyone in their right mind paying more for a comparable Acura TL. I now feel the same way about the Infiniti JX/Q-something. Pathfinder has a fantastic interior."
ahightower,Jun-14,LOL. I'm sure the puns will multiply.
ahightower,Jun-14,"People like to believe they've ""discovered"" some unappreciated gem. But the mark of a great design is that it still looks cool even when hundreds of thousands agree. Fusion has that look, especially in an interesting color and/or with nice wheels. Although, a really great design is one that looks just as good on the base model and doesn't need lots of ""jewelry"". I admit my Accord needs its spoiler and exhaust tips and wheels to stand out. A base Fusion is far less boring than a base Accord."
backy,Jun-14,"I agree on having a base model that looks good and doesn't need a lot of ""jewelery"". All the cars I have today are technically ""base"" models, and all are sharp looking cars even today, in some cases nearly 15 years after they were designed. The one thing that can most easily ruin the appearance of a base sedan is the cheap-looking plastic wheel covers some automakers choose to put on them, so you have to pay the extra bucks for alloys."
stickguy,Jun-14,"oh, one of my pet peeves is steelies with hub caps. Not sure I could do it even if it was just a super cheap lease appliance beater."
backy,Jun-14,"I don't mind plastic wheel covers if they're decent looking. My Rio5 has good looking wheel covers IMO, as did my previous leased car (Sentra 2.0S). But some are really cheap-looking. Ford and Honda are some of the worst offenders there, IMO."
brian125,Jun-14,"lol........... You are so right.. Honda should be ashamed of themselves putting those funky rims on the Lx CRV models, and Pilots. .................... And Ford shame on you too."
akirby,Jun-14,I don't remember a recent Ford with plastic wheel covers.
brian125,Jun-14,Not all are wheel covers. Ford has gotten better. Check out the basic Ford focus wheel cover. Ford makes another one called the Hollander awful they were on the 2012 and 13's . . looks like ones from the 80's and 90's. You see them on the cheap small basic models.
ab348,Jun-14,"@akirby - In the midsize category the Fusion S model states that it offers 16"" steel wheels with ""premium"" wheel covers. Can't say I've ever noticed one. The compact Focus has some of the worst-looking, cheapest plastic wheel covers I have ever seen."
robr2,Jun-14,"Ford had a wheel cover on the last generation Fusion that looked like this:
It went over a 5 spoke steel wheel:
Chrysler used them as well. They really do look like alloy wheels."
backy,Jun-14,"The Focus' awful plastic wheel covers are a good example. The CR-V LXs are awful too, but base Accord's wheel covers haven't been very good in recent years either."
akirby,Jun-14,You hardly ever see base models around here. Although the one above sure looks like a regular wheel.
stickguy,Jun-14,The base Altima has hubbies. You need to get into one of the S packages to get alloys.
backy,Jun-14,Here's the Fusion S' standard wheel. I confirmed on ford.com that is the current wheel. Not nearly as nice as the one pictured earlier. But not the most awful I've seen.
[Deleted User],Jun-14,"Hey Backy. My mother in law has a dark red Mallfinder, and has the exact same seating configuration. The kids like it, and she likes the way it drives and the power of the V6. She has 29K and no CVT issues, or any other issues. She has the worst commute. 95 to 495 to Tysons. I refuse to even go there. Fortunately a new Silverline subway station is due to open in 75 days, greatly reducing car traffic, and new ""Hotlanes"" are open allowing folks in a hurry (and rich) to pay extra to use a special HOCV lane for the wealthy (or the hurried). So, basically this vehicle idles for 1.5 hours each way crawling to and from work."
[Deleted User],Jun-14,"I have decided to not get rims and to continue saving for the coilovers. Everyone on the Optima site says it makes driving much more fun, with no floaty-rebound over bumps and uneven pavement. The new speakers have totally fixed the not-so-good base model stereo. So, I am pretty happy with it right now, and it still looks showroom fresh 2.6 years later."
ahightower,Jun-14,"And the CarMax sale of our old Yukon went very well. The price was very good. $1500 more than any dealer offered as a trade, hit Edmunds TMV right on the nose. Given the condition and desirability of large SUVs in this area, I believe I could have gotten perhaps $500 more as a private party sale, but not having to deal with craigslist weirdos is worth a lot to me. One stop, sign the paperwork, take the money and run. I am watching their website to see it listed, curious to see what they expect to get for it."
dudleyr,Jun-14,I don't have a problem with steel wheels. Why hide them with hideous hubcaps.
brian125,Jun-14,Above rims look similar to the CRV lx models rims..
[Deleted User],Jun-14,"Well, a numbers matching 1974 Porsche 911 is a little different than a 96 Civic with endless cheap modification possibilities. The average young Civic driver sees 100's of cars like his a day, many with wheels costing far more than the car. It is a culture where nothing is taboo and adding an aftermarket set of well, anything does not affect the value of the car either positively or negatively. It is just fun."
[Deleted User],Jun-14,"Just to be clear, I am doing the coilovers first, and the wheels later on. Everyone (sans none) has told me to keep the wheels stock and get the front end coilovers first. The bouncy rebound of the EX Kia is annoying."
[Deleted User],Jun-14,"I don't know about you guys,l but I have seen a fair share of cars with plastic hubcaps going down the road with the cap warped from heat, or improperly installed, or with a missing clip, unbalanced and wobbling along. I firmly believe the base model hub-cap jobs are aimed at women, who could care less how the wheel is made as long as it is shiny."
[Deleted User],Jun-14,"@robr2 said:

Yes, the Ford hubcaps pictured are the base models on the Fusion and the Escape. They look similar to the top end alloys that I think look very sharp. Not sure if the real alloys are 17"" or 18""
But they look good,. I think the new Escape is the best looking small CUV, with Mazda close second, and the RAV4 3rd. Sorry Honda, the CRV is Borrrriiing.
Afterthought....I would rather have the steel wheels w/o the hubcaps. Just paint or chrome the 5 star steel wheels and there would bye no reason for a separate part number for a plastic hubcap that will most likely fall off, get stolen, or warp from heat (in the front due to brake heat)."
backy,Jun-14,"I've never had a problem with a plastic wheel cover warping or wobbling. But I have had my share of scrapes of alloys on curbs where the top part sticks out--common in my area. And alloys that wear out over time.
As for base model cars with wheel covers being aimed at women... I don't know about that. As I've stated, I prefer wheel covers to alloys if the covers are good-looking. Like this example from my 2010 Sentra 2.0S, off lease last year:
Maybe they are aimed at people who don't want to pay extra for decent-looking wheels if they can help it!"
explorerx4,Jun-14,"Fusion is in the shop. Last Friday, the check engine light came on. Drove it today for the first time since. Light was still on, and after a few miles it started making a not loud fog horn noise every few seconds.
Dealer, only 2 miles away was not open yet, so went over there an hour or so later, but car didn't make the noise.
On the way home from work, the noise started again, so I turned around and headed to the dealer.
Just before I got there, the car stalled twice.
Anyways, drove it into the service garage and left it running.
Several people came over to the car and could heard the noise.
It was coming out the capless fuel filler, and sounded like the car was farting every few seconds.
We all got some chuckles about that.
I told the service writer, I'm glad you heard it, so I don't have to try to describe it to you and now you have to explain the noise.
They brought me over to Enterprise and I have an Altima loaner.
Impressions will follow over the next few days. Already some noticeable differences.
Altima has a CVT, right?
Heading out to clean the car in a few minutes. Lots of bugs and tar on it."
stickguy,Jun-14,"yeah, Altima is a CVT. I will be interested in hearing your impressions on both driving them back to back. I test drove an Altima, and actually liked it. Never have driven a Fusion though.
wait, you are going to to clean the rental? I thought only Fintail did that!"
explorerx4,Jun-14,"@stickguy First thing my wife said when she pulled in the driveway was 'You're cleaning a loaner?' Took me an hour and it looks a lot better now.

""Lots Of Boost, Not Much Eco
By Derek Kreindler on June 17, 2014
Just prior to Ford’s fuel economy ratings adjustment, I returned a brand new Fusion with a 1.5L Ecoboost engine. The last car I’ve driven with 1500 cc’s worth of displacement was my grandmother’s 2000 Civic, with its D-Series, single cam engine and 4-speed automatic. You would think that such a tiny engine would help Ford’s mid-sizer deliver solid fuel economy, but the best I could do was a mere 21 mpg in mixed driving.
According to the EPA, the same Fusion gets 23 mpg in town and 36 mpg on the highway, and 28 mpg combined – that’s about 25 percent better than I got. I’ve never had particularly good luck with the Ecoboost engines, whether it’s the 1.6L in the Escape or the 2.0L in the MKZ in normal driving. My one good experience, in the utterly fantastic Fiesta ST, saw me return 40 mpg over a stretch of two lane highway at 60 mph. But who drives 60 mph on the highway, let alone in the Fiesta ST.
The Ecoboost engines are like the high school classmate who got infuriatingly good grades, but you always knew you were smarter than. They simply happened to be really good at standardized tests and repeating back information, even if their critical thinking and “streets smarts” were lacking.
So, these engines perform really well on the EPA fuel economy tests, but utterly fall apart in the real world. Driving them as one normally would means dipping into the boost of the turbo engine, and subsequently consuming lots of fuel. For an engine that’s been sold on the age-old promise of “the power of [insert large engine here], the fuel economy of [insert smaller cylinder count here]“, that’s not good at all. Especially when you are publicly forced to revise your own fuel economy estimates.....""
(more at the link)"
benjaminh,Jun-14,"TTAC also says, ""....There’s a lot to recommend about the Fusion overall: it looks great, rides well, has a solid, well-built feel and they’ve finally fixed the once-awful MyFord Touch system. But I can’t seem to find a powertrain that works well...."""
b25nut,Jun-14,He must not have tried the Fusion Hybrid. Plenty of power and 43.9 mpg in my last 800 miles. My wife is driving it today for the first time for a full day. I'm not optimistic about the mileage she'll get.
explorerx4,Jun-14,"@benjaminh You read it on the internet, so it must be true.
I just read an article where Consumer Reports was touting the Highlander Hybrid (51k) as a great vehicle, although to cost 12k more than a loaded Highlander (39k)."
akirby,Jun-14,"Ecoboost engines are much more sensitive to throttle inputs. To get the EPA mileage you have to coast a lot with your foot completely off the gas pedal. Short trips also kill it (as it does for hybrids). They have the ability to get better than average mpg driven the right way but they also have the ability to get worse than average. It's just a wider range than NA engines. They also seem to be more sensitive to E-10 (EPA tests are done with pure gasoline, not E-10).
I averaged 17 mpg in my 2006 Fusion 3.0L. My 2013 2.0L EB averages 22 with about 40 more lb/ft of torque. Both of those are the EPA city ratings."
stickguy,Jun-14,"I think our RDX (with the VCM engine) is also sensitive to how you drive it. I get much better MPG than my wife, even in the same usage. I tend to feather the gas and coast a lot to watch the instant MPG readout spike to 40+, and keep it above 30. It is a technique for being very light on the gas, and coasting when possible. The wife tends to be a mash/brake type and has a heavy foot in general. Just does not drive ""hybrid friendly"" (which I think is the same technique that maximizes VCM mileage)"
[Deleted User],Jun-14,"Your A TRUE CAR GUY. IF IT IS DIRTY...CLEAN IT! But women don't understand how that behavior does not transfer well to housework. Cars are art. Houses are made of trees mostly... just not into them.
I do have to add a bit of told-you-so. My Asian car has zero problems, warning lights, weird noises, rattles, or any other annoying problems, much less drivability problems and breakdowns. I am not easy on my cars either, and neither is the congestion in this area. Now at 28,600 miles. No turbo to break, no battery (that drives the car) to die. I am a pretty happy camper."
benjaminh,Jun-14,"My guess is that KIA's quality is on par with the best at this point. I still have a feeling that Honda might have a very slight edge on a few things, but that may no longer be true.
One thing I came to realize 12-14 years ago, which this new GM scandal has emphasized, is that you are trusting your life and the lives of everyone in the car and around you to the parts in your car, many of which are small and inexpensive. But you want these parts to be well-engineered, even if they cost a few cents more.
As I dealt with safety recall after safety recall on my brand-new 2000 Ford Focus ZTS, I realized that Ford was not taking this seriously enough for my tastes. I got really tired of it. Wheels that might fall off? Engine might catch fire? Seriously? wtf?
Went to Honda and haven't looked back. They aren't perfect, but Honda's engineers have more power than at some other companies imho. It's a higher level of engineering than some middle class cars even today.
But the gap has narrowed a lot.
As I just said, KIA/Hyundai are probably now equal to almost everything in a Honda. Ford is much better too, even though I probably won't go near them again with a ten-foot pole. GM, obviously, has some work to do....
Just my 2 cents."
bmb1767,Jun-14,One thing that Hyundai/Kia hasn't come close to Honda on is residual value. And I am the proud (not!) owner of a 2013 Hyundai Genesis.
akirby,Jun-14,The worst vehicles today are better than the best vehicles 20 years ago. The gap from worst to first is much narrower and with one or two exceptions none of today's vehicles are terrible. Today it comes down more to features and cost and styling and options.
ab348,Jun-14,"Hyundai/Kia have come a long way but they are not there yet. Reliability-wise, perhaps, although I know several people who have had ongoing, unfixable problems with their H/K vehicles. Materials quality and mechanical design, they are not there yet.
In terms of the recalls, I would suggest we are not seeing a complete picture yet. GM is purging every possible issue. Ford is owning up to certain issues. Chrysler has not done a whole lot yet but my gut tells me they are far from faultless. Toyota has had its issues in the past. H/K's corporate culture seems to be one of getting away with as much as they can until they can no longer avoid taking responsibility, as in the fuel economy and stated horsepower scandals. Time will tell."
dudleyr,Jun-14,"Hyundai / Kia have come a long way and can certainly be trusted. I don't think they quite match Toyota or Honda yet (CR tests bear this out). My limited experience with a 10 day Sonata rental (2011 or 12 model) was not great. Car drove fine, but it was hard to get past some of the interior bits. The LED's looked like they came out of a cheap 80's alarm clock. I also had to exchange it as the key could not be removed from the ignition (I tried all the suggestions in the manual and the internet and the rental place did as well). They gave me a Camry.
GM scares me a little. There is an excellent book about them called ""The Reckoning"". I highly recommend giving it a read. It parallels the rise of Nissan to the fall of GM - mostly in the 60's. GM was making some of the best cars in the world and Nissan's were pathetic and barely able to get up to highway speeds in the U.S. They just kept improving by a little bit every year. Meanwhile GM knew they were on top with large fast vehicles that could cruise effortlessly. They began looking for every little place they could save a penny, to the point where the penny they saved would cost the consumer many dollars down the road because the vehicle would not hold up like it should. Accountants were driving design not engineers.
I worry that the culture is too engrained and these recent recalls are not helping to ease my feelings. They still do make some nice Mid Sized Sedans - CR recently rated the Impala very highly (maybe technically a full size, but the Malibu has a tiny back seat). I just don't trust that they are doing everything to make the car as well as they can."
ab348,Jun-14,"I read The Reckoning many years ago. It is an account of those times and really was only one of many similar accounts of how GM was taken over by a bean-counter mentality - no news there. Iacocca was saying the same things about Ford in his 1980s book. The power of the Ford Finance staff back then was absolute. And Chrysler was run into the ground when it was run by Lynn Townsend, an accountant, in the 1960's and early '70s. You cannot cut costs forever and remain successful. Interestingly, I think Nissan is facing many of the same issues right now. Ghosn is notorious for cheapening things (see their infatuation with CVTs) and I do not find their vehicles particularly appealing.
Whether GM can change is an open question. It is still a huge company with all the cultural challenges that implies. It will take years to determine whether they can do it."
explorerx4,Jun-14,"So far, I've put about 50 miles on the Altima. CVT is somewhat noticeable, but not dramatically so. The drivetrain has a slight vibration between 1k and 2k and sometimes it seems to provide some additional braking effect when it isn't needed. The steering has some heft to it, which I like. A lot of cars have what I feel is over boosted power steering. Seats are comfortable and generally, it rides well and it's pretty quiet. Seems like a good road trip car. Handling capabilities are noticeably less than my Fusion. Took a damp off ramp and could feel the front tires starting to push out at a speed that my Fusion wouldn't have blinked at. Average mileage has been on 31.8 since I picked it up. Interior is much different than my Fusion. In the Fusion, my finger naturally land on the rear window switches on the door. In the Altima, I have to reach way back in order to operate any of the switches. Putting the shift into 'park' feels like where reverse is in the Fusion, so I always check it just in case. Outside, it is just a strange looking car, not a plus in my book. It does have some nice electronic features like individual tire pressure read outs.
I did some looking around on the internet for a problem similar to what my Fusion is experiencing, but didn't find anything, so I'm guessing it's somewhat unique to my car."
backy,Jun-14,"Related to discussion on quality... in the latest JD Power IQS study, Hyundai was the top-rated non-premium brand. GM also did pretty well, as did Kia. This is only quality measured over the first 90 days, but Hyundai made a huge jump from 10th to 4th in one year. I think a lot of that is most of their models have been around awhile now, including the Sonata, so they've had time to work out the glitches. The Sonata was 2nd in the mid-sized sedan class, behind the Malibu."
explorerx4,Jun-14,"Dealer called today. Fusion needs a valve in the vapor recovery system. It's going to take some time to get the part, so probably won't get it back until at least the middle of next week."
brian125,Jun-14,Just got down to my house in Myrtle Beach pulled my Genesis out of the garage wiped it down and went for a ride. The more I drive this car the more I love it. Just turned 1000 miles. What a good job Hyundai did with this vehicle.. I probably will trade this model in for a 2016 and the smaller motor. Till then this car is alot of fun to drive with its 429 h/p. The new Tech features on the redesign 2015 Genesis are very impressive? Hyundai and Kia have come along way since there first models Excel in 1985 and the Kia sephia and Sportages.
brian125,Jun-14,"Kia Motors, headquartered in Seoul, is South Korea's second-largest automobile manufacturer, following the Hyundai Motor Company, with sales of over 2.7 million vehicles in 2012 and almost 2.75 million vehicles in 2013. As of June 2012, the company is 32.8% owned by the Hyundai Motor Company.
Starting in 1986 (when only 26 cars were manufactured, followed by over 95,000 the next year), Kia rejoined the automobile industry in partnership with Ford. Kia produced several Mazda-derived vehicles for both domestic sales in South Korea and for export into other countries. These models included the Kia Pride, based on the Mazda 121, and the Avella, which were sold in North America and Australasia as the Ford Festiva and Ford Aspire.
In 1992, Kia Motors America was incorporated in the United States. The first Kia-branded vehicles in the United States were sold from four dealerships in Portland, Oregon in February 1994."
ab348,Jun-14,"You left out the part about Kia going bankrupt in 1997 and being acquired by Hyundai, who outbid Ford, the following year."
brian125,Jun-14,"Hyundai owns 32% of Kia. How bad where those Sephia, Sportage vehicles back then. I know several people owning both models and having a lot of problems with them."
wayne21,Jun-14,"Hyundai has been in the car business for quite some time. When I was in Korea in the 1970s, the Hyundai pony was a very popular car in Korea. IIRC, they hired the Japanese to build the factory and basically produced a Mitsubishi clone called the pony... which became known as the excel when it was exported to the US."
ab348,Jun-14,The Pony was sold in Canada in the early-mid '80s and was a fairly primitive rear-drive sedan. The Excel replaced it and was Hyundai's first FWD car exported here.
backy,Jun-14,"I am crossing my fingers but I may lose the car pictured here. My daughter accidentally tapped the accelerator instead of the brake while parking the Mazda6 at a mall parking ramp the other day, and pretty well mangled the right front by hitting the car in front of her... which just happened to be an E Class wagon. Not heavy damage on the Mercedes, but a body shop just looking at one of those has gotta be pricey. Its owner was nowhere to be found, so I left the license plate (knocked off) on the windshield so the driver would see that something had happened (garage was pretty dark) with a note, and they took it pretty well. I am just hoping my insurance company doesn't total-out the Mazda. It won't take much to do that, as on paper its value isn't that high, but it's in near-pristine condition for a 2005 car despite relatively high miles (165k). I may have to go used-car shopping soon."
brian125,Jun-14,"Backy,
You did the right thing by leaving a note. I'm just wondering in today's times if 10 people did the same thing how many would leave a note and number??
Something good will come out of this situation for you.
Hopefully the Car Gods will shine down on you.
3 yrs ago i'm playing golf in Myrtle beach. I find a brief case in the parking lot standing alone. 2 spots from my car. I grab the case walk over to my car open it up and find some business papers and a large sum of money, checks etc. I called this guy up and told him i found his case. His first words to me was please tell me the money was not taken. I met him 30 mins later gave him the case and refused to take a dime. This made me feel good to return this brief case and money. Nobody would know if i took the case and it never crossed my mind. Maybe 30 years ago it would. What stuck with me to this day is To see how happy and grateful this man was crying and hugging me with joy will last a life time with me. I have had nothing but good luck these past 3 yrs .. karma or what?............................ I believe in pay it forward. Hopefully you to."
robr2,Jun-14,"Nah - unless it's aluminum or carbon fiber, it's just another car to the body shop. Parts might be a little more expensive but the E is MB's top selling car so parts cost may be normal. Besides, based on the age, your insurance may only pay for used or aftermarket parts."
Mr_Shiftright,Jun-14,"Just be sure you get a fair settlement from insurance on the Mazda. As Robr2 said, repairing the Benz should be no problem if it's just sheet metal and plastic. Besides, to insurance companies, it's all about numbers. They don't get ""upset"" with you about anything, nor do they ""congratulate"" you when you do something good for them. It's all very dispassionate, numbers-crunching business. They really don't care what you hit--it's just another claim to them that goes into the plus and minus calculations."
explorerx4,Jun-14,"Started some research looking for a new Fusion. Found one I think I would like, so I'm working on filling in the boxes to see if it will work. Looking at an SE Hybrid. It will work itself out over the next few weeks."
stickguy,Jun-14,"isn't the one you have fairly new? this a replacement, or an addition?"
explorerx4,Jun-14,"It would be a replacement. I have a 2013 Titanium model. I don't really need the power it has, so I'm thinking of trading for the challenge of driving a hybrid. I do like the toys, although I probably would be giving up something. The only one I know for sure is remote start. Well, plus the 19 inch dark stainless rims."
backy,Jun-14,"Good news, the body shop told me that the frame rail wasn't hit and it doesn't look like the damage will total my Mazda6! But I'm sure to get a new front bumper out of it (to match the new rear bumper I got last year, see below)... and I declined the option to use non-OEM parts.
brian125, I was glad my daughter didn't flee the scene but called me. I think she was so upset she couldn't have driven anywhere anyway. Funny thing is, last fall someone hit this same car in the right rear while it was parked in a different mall parking lot, causing $2500 in damage (with $500 out of my pocket). No note from them of course. I don't know how they can sleep at night. I hope I raised my kids to do the right thing. A couple of years ago, as I was leaving a Twins game with my family, my middle son started walking away from us. I asked him where he was going, and he said he'd found a wallet and was going to turn it in. He showed it to me, and it was stuffed full of cash -- not sure how much was in there, but it was a big wad. He never got a ""thank you"" from the owner of the wallet, but I'll bet my son sleeps fine at night."
Mr_Shiftright,Jun-14,"it's about taking responsibility for your actions. I still chide my friend about the time he called me up needing a ride because he couldn't find his car keys. He said: ""The key got lost"". LOL! Did it run away from home?"

nyccarguy,Jun-14,"I drove and was impressed by a 2014 VW Passat TDI SEL last night. I went on a lengthy test drive which included a nice mix of city, highway, & twisty back roads. The thing that stuck out the most was the Passat's ride. It soaked up road imperfections very well while remaining composed and stable. The chassis was well tuned and didn't just have soft springs. The body didn't wallow. The car itself is very smooth and drove much like a Mercedes-Benz."

The boyfriend , quiet the whole time... apologized for her and we shook hands and left. Some people are walking time bombs I guess. We made sure to take pictures of the car in case she tries to blame so damage on me. I was a oerfe3ct gentleman. I Just have all of my kids in the car, and it is low so I do not want to scrape the bottom of the car. I was in no way going any slower than anyone else though."
explorerx4,Jun-14,"Still have the Altima loaner. Power is always there, has never felt under powered. At low speeds it's really nice to drive. Body feels really solid, but suspension gets out of sync on patched up roads. There is a drive train vibration between 1-2k rpms at all speeds. Also noticed I have to turn the radio up when on the highway, but not sure why. The average MPG and speed has not changed since I picked it up. I find that kind of strange."
ab348,Jun-14,This seems to be a chronic Nissan problem. I remember this being widely discussed with the Rogue at the time of its introduction.
wayne21,Jun-14,"I had been waiting to see what you thought of the Altima. Last month, I rented an Altima at the Portland (OR) airport and drove it to northern California (avenue of the Giants). I did a lot of stop and go driving (3 days) on the way to Fortuna (south of Eureka). I noted CVT shutter at low RPM whether accelerating or decelerating, but got used to it. I actually enjoyed the smoothness of the CVT in lieu of the obvious shifting in regular transmissions. Aside from the vibrations at low RPM, I had no issues at all with the car. I drove just over 600 miles on the original tank of gas and the refuel light went on just before checking into the hotel. It read 37.7 mpg. I didn't do the math, but had no problems with that. The one BIG PROBLEM I had was the airbag light. It came on four times in three days while my wife was in the passenger seat. We stopped each time, she got out then back in and the airbag was fine. (I checked the build date and it was built after their recall on this issue.) We called the rental company and they sent us to Eureka where we got a camry. The plus to the camry was the large backup camera. It was on par with the Altima with one glaring exception - the mpg. I did all the driving and while we averaged 37.7 on the Altima we averaged 30.2 on the camry (just over 600 miles put on it, too, under similar conditions). I was in awe at the difference in mileage. I drove both cars like they were mine and remember being really surprised at the number of miles I had on one tank in the Altima. I had to fill up on the way back to Portland and again just before getting to the airport with the camry. I have no doubt about the mileage on either car. In all honesty, if I was to buy one of those cars I would like to choose the Altima, but the airbag issue would be a deal killer. I've read some of the Altima blogs and it seems Nissan hasn't taken care of the issue for those who've had the recall repair performed or for the cars being built after the cars involved in the recall."
wayne21,Jun-14,"A follow-up to my rental car post (hopefully without interruptions this time). I had to laugh at the interaction in Eureka when we went in with the Altima. The guy looked at my wife, then said that no one under 110 lbs (she is small) should be riding in the passenger seat and that's why the light was coming on. He wanted to give us another Altima. I asked if I was to chauffeur her while she rode in the back or would he think it best for me to take her to an all-you-can eat buffet before taking the car! What an idiot! I had to call corporate to get a different car (it had to do with state registration of the vehicle and airport issues, but that wasn't my problem) and that's how I got a camry. But of particular concern to me was the airbag issue. My wife and I are thinking of purchasing an infinit Q50 and it was on the recall list for airbags. I'm not interested in paying $50k for a car and having to constantly look at the airbag light to see if my wife's airbag is working."
stickguy,Jun-14,"I only took a brief test drive in the Altima, but overall was impressed. At the time I was considering a job that would be about 100 miles RT, so MPG and range was important. an 18,5 gal tank, combined with the expected high 30s highway was a bit plus.
if I was to buy, I would want a longer drive including on the highway, but I suspect that would be less of an issue with a CVT, meaning less noticeable."
brian125,Jun-14,"I have been reading alot of bad reviews on the Q50 from buyers. This new model seems to have alot of 1st year kinks. I would wait for the 2nd year production on this vehicle.. Edmunds reviews on the Q 50 are not good for a car priced at almost 50 k . there are so many better choices. ES 350, Avalon, Genesis . to name a few. I'm sure CR reports review will be alot worse then edmunds reviews."

Oh, on another topic, good luck buying a Chevy Cruise today. Another recall, making the total of recalls in the past 2013-2014 model year at 44 affecting 15 million vehicles. Looks like my dreams of an Impala SS are fading to black."
ab348,Jun-14,I don't think it is a recall yet. They have issued a stop-sell order until they figure out the extent of the problem. Sounds similar to the Nissan airbag issue mentioned above.
akirby,Jun-14,You'd have a really hard time trying to buy a Chevy Cruise period.
ahightower,Jun-14,"Re: Nissan CVT vibration, it's one reason I decided to lease our new Pathfinder. They say a software update and beefed up internals (chain vs. belt, though I don't pretend to fully understand how it works) make the Pathfinder's CVT more robust and gives 5K towing capacity. And we can always convert to purchase it if still satisfied in 36 months. But between that known issue and prior poor service experiences with a 2004 Quest, I thought to myself, I really like it now, but not sure I still will when it's not new..."
ahightower,Jun-14,"Re: ECON button. I have one and never use it. I'm consistently down to 25 mpg with my new commute (Accord Sport 6MT). Was nearly 30 before with a longer, less congested, almost all highway drive. Haven't got the patience to see if ECON mode would help. When I want to drive soft, I'll drive soft. When I want to giddyup, I want all the power. And when it's hot, I want the dang AC on full blast."
stevedebi,Jun-14,"I believe the newer cars have both a weight sensor and a height sensor. If there is sufficient weight but not height the car thinks there is a child up front and deactivates the airbag. If your wife is small she might be better off without the airbag working. That is the whole point of the sensors - the airbags can be dangerous to short people. But I don't know exactly what parameters are being used these days. I do recall that one can legally have a switch installed here in California for the driver seat to deactivate the airbag for smaller passengers. Or at least that is the way it was about a decade ago when we got our Civic and considered it.
EDIT: But that should never cause the airbag light to go off and on. I'm speaking of the passenger airbag light, not normal dashboard light. The passenger should either meet the specs (airbag on) or not (airbag off) - never changing."
wayne21,Jun-14,"My wife has been in quite a few cars and has never had a problem with the airbag being deactivated (i.e. not recognizing her in the seat). And if it truly was her, I'd have to ask why did it go off 4 times in 3 days? Why didn't it either stay on or stay off? She wasn't moving around in the seat. When I searched Altima and airbag it seems this has actually been an issue for Nissan for a very long time."

Listen up Kia board or directors: WE DONT CARE about your Tiger snout/nose styling. Please just let Peter Schreyer do the designing, and you guys deal with the money and the factory. I would not buy a Cadenza be3cause the front end has NO flow....no symmetry. It doesn't do anything for me. You need to use the Optima as the base model to build on. Have your upper priced car's with a front end more like that. It bet Peter would design a BEAUTIFUL car if you let him.

dudleyr,Jun-14,"I almost always have the econ button on in my Accord 6MT. No need running the compressor all the time when it provides more than enough cooling running half the time - just throwing energy away, but I guess that is the energy policy for this country in general. I also prefer the cruise control in econ mode as it is a little more relaxed and does not fight to make sure you don't slow down 1 mph going up the steepest hill. I am happy to slow down a tad uphill and conversely speed up a tad on the way down - much more efficient.
If I need full power it is still there - just floor the pedal and you get the same power as with eco mode off."
[Deleted User],Jun-14,"Dudeyr, If I am on my way home on the beltway and my car slows down up the hill, I get 18 angry, frazzled people all moving left to the shoulder to se who the left lane impediment is. It is almost impossible to calmly cruise down the road here during peak hours, which are 5 am to 10 am. then from 3PM to 8PM. But that is deceptive too, because promptly at 10am construction begins and they shut down at least one lane. I don't know how people drive downtown daily. Twice a week is enough for me. Quite enough."
suydam,Jun-14,I test drove my Accord EX-L in Eco mode and have kept it that way ever since. I get excellent fuel economy and the car drives like a dream. Win win.
[Deleted User],Jun-14,I drive like a scalded cat. LOL.
dudleyr,Jun-14,"It does not work for everybody, but it does not slow down very much maybe 1 or 2 mph. My Sienna is so aggressive that it shifts down 2 gears going up even moderate hills and winds up going faster than I have the cruise set for at the top. Really wish it had eco. I don't think the Accord is that bad, but have not really driven it up any real hills with eco off. Since the 6MT is geared so short it can go up a very steep hill with no trouble in 6th gear.
Probably don't want to be using cruise in situations where there are 18 people behind you anyway. I used to live in DC - traffic drove me to a saner place (South Dakota). My commute to work is 5 minutes - if I walk. I have not waited more than 1 cycle for a stoplight in years. There was a traffic jam on the interstate about 7 or 8 years ago that was kind of annoying (construction during Sturgis), but that is the only one I have hit in 20 years."
explorerx4,Jun-14,"My sisters' Prius V has an Econ button. Tried it once, that was enough. Speaking of hills, my Fusion, still siting at the dealer, has some kind of grade logic built into the transmission. It will downshift a gear or two to hold the speed. It could be once I apply the brake, I'll have to check. The Altima definitely picks up speed on the down hill. I'll have to check if it speeds up after stepping on the brake while coasting down the hill."
akirby,Jun-14,If you're going downhill and tap the brakes the Fusion will downshift to maintain speed.
Sandman6472,Jun-14,"Have the ECO button on all the time in my Tuscon and it seems to drive nicely. If I need power, I hit the gas a bit harder and off it goes. So far, very pleased with it after hitting 9k this morning...not too big and not too small and love the ease of ingress/egress, the main reason for the purchase after all. It suits my needs perfectly and though the mileage could be better, I like the vehicle overall. Good decision to keep the XM radio after the trial period because I love my 6 presets and the handy steering wheel controls. On a 10 point scale...give the Tuscon a ""9"" overall!

tm_014,Jun-14,"I'm trying to decide between the '15 Mazda 6 i touring and the '14 Accord EX. The OTD prices I've been quoted are very close to one another. I was secretly hoping one would be different to sway my opinion. Fortunately or unfortunately that didn't happen.
The allure of the accord, if you can say that, is it's reliability and bland design that should age well.
Is there any reliability issues to be concerned about with Mazda? There is little to no ""real world"" information about the Mazda 6, just glowing reviews from the car magazines and online.
Part of me says go with the Accord, they are everywhere and everyone must be driving them for a reason. The other part of me says get the car that's different and no people have on the road.
I plan on keeping my car for a long time, so this isn't a 3-4yr decision, but a 8-10 year."
ahightower,Jun-14,"I don't want to have to floor it. It just feels dulled to me in ECON mode, and the zippy engine is a big part of what sold me on the car in the first place. Not sure about the AC compressor, but I keep climate control on automatic. It can back off when it gets me down to my desired temp. To each his own. ""Throwing energy away"" is one way to put it. I consider it put to rather good use, and I'm still twice as green as all the bros in lifted pickups sitting next to me in traffic."
dudleyr,Jun-14,Very true.
m6user,Jun-14,"@tm_014,
Both good cars. You see Accord more because of good history, more dealers, bigger company, etc. Mazda is a much smaller car company so you will realistically see fewer of them. I like Mazdas but I will not try to sell you on them. I have to figure you're smart enough to decide on your own. But to your actual question, the Mazda6 we have is 7 years old with 109000 miles. There has been absolutely no repairs required on this car. Two minor free dealer adjustments which probably cost them a total of $10 were made early on. I've had over 35 cars in my life and I think this has been the most trouble free car ever. I looked at the Mazda6 ratings on Consumers Report before I bought. The recent past is a fairly good indicator of future results. I haven't looked at the Mazda6 reports in CR recently but I haven't heard of any big problems either.
They both have some new technology that hasn't been around all that long so I think both of them are probably similar in that regard. The new Skyactiv drivetrains in the Mazda and the new Earthdreams/CVT tranny in the Accord. Have read reviews on both from consumers at cars.com, Edmunds etc and haven't seen any kind of trend or repeated problems. I say take the one you like the looks of and the one you like to drive the best. Can't go wrong with either."
ahightower,Jun-14,"@tm_014, Mazda6 was my second choice. It was a tough call. No doubt the 6 is more attractive, and both handle very well, but a few little things put Accord on top for me:
-Rear seat leg room
-Materials quality
-Power
-Gearbox
-Reputation = resale value
I came out of a 2008 Mazda3, had no serious issues. AC blower motor died once (under warranty) and was beginning to act up again with sporadic refusals to blow any air. That was going to be $500 to repair, and too difficult for me to handle on my own because of its location. But I had it 93K miles and was still on the original clutch and brakes with plenty of life on the pads. Other than the AC being a bit outmatched by the Texas summer heat, I wouldn't hesitate to buy another from a quality standpoint.
You can't go wrong here. Get the one that will make you smile every day of those 8-10 years."
stevedebi,Jun-14,"Ah, my favorite complaint about modern cars. I remember my first couple of cars (in the 1970s through 1990); when I turned the temperature control up or down, the A/C compressor cycled. It kept the car at the temperature I wanted and still saved gas. On the cars I've had since then, when the A/C button is on, the compressor is on - even if I turn up the temperature. It blends warm air with the colder air - which is stupid, wasting gas to cool air only to make it warmer. I suppose it may make for somewhat less stress on the compressor, but I still prefer the earlier, simpler system."
akirby,Jun-14,It's not stupid. It dehumidifies the air. Remember how the windows used to fog up when it rained in the wintertime and you had to use the defroster? You don't usually need to do that now because the compressor dehumidifies the air before warming it up. It also keeps the compressor lubed.
stevedebi,Jun-14,"I prefer to handle dshumidification myself, but in any case I never had any problems with fogging windows on the vehicles that cycled the compressor. On my recent vehicles, the compressor does not run in the Winter unless the defrosters are switched on or the A/C button is pressed; it has been that way for the past 14 years on my new vehicles. So I don't think the statement is true (at least for the vehicles I've owned, including my new 2014 VW).
I don't know why it would keep the compressor better lubed, since it would be cycling anyway if the A/C button is pressed.
I stand by my former statements, including my summary opinion. The car manufacturers are causing the vehicles to waste more fuel to cool air that is then warmed to passenger temperature settings.
EDIT: Which is not to say anything more than our opinions are different."
m6user,Jun-14,I used to drive 6cyl cars in the 70s with 150hp that only got about 15 mpg on average. Now I can drive a heavier car with 180hp and average almost 30mpg. Engineers must be doing something right.
akirby,Jun-14,The oil is in the refrigerant so running the A/C periodically keeps everything lubed properly (gaskets/orings/seals). Most modern automatic climate control systems will run the A/C for dehumidification even if the A/C light isn't on.
akirby,Jun-14,"And I was only responding to the assertion that it was ""stupid"" to run the A/C when you're getting warm air. It doesn't cost any more to warm cold air - engine heat is free. So you get the benefit of drier air. That's where the ""auto"" part comes in. If you don't want it to work automatically put it in manual mode and you can control it yourself.
My other point is you can't assume the compressor is off just because the A/C light is off. Some vehicles run the A/C automatically without turning on the light."
stevedebi,Jun-14,"My 2003 Honda CRV was that way. You could turn off the A/C light, but the compressor still ran. That was a useless setting! But it still ran only in defroster mode."
benjaminh,Jun-14,"We keep the eco button on our 2013 Accord CVT on. Seems pretty subtle. Acceleration is fast whenever you want it, and the AC is always very cold when you want it. I think it mostly just shifts into the economy gearing when cruising. Since we've exceeded the hwy mpg rating several times, imho it works w/o any pain.++"
stevedebi,Jun-14,"I guess I wasn't clear. It costs more that it would to cycle the compressor; when the compressor isn't running, the vehicle is using less fuel. If they cycled the compressor to match an approximate temperature setting, whenever the compressor was off the engine would use less fuel, resulting in lower fuel use overall. Under the current system, the compressor is running all the time. Hence my comments.
Unfortunately, the compressor will not cycle even in so-called ""manual"" mode. Unless you mean me turning it on and off. But that is what automation is for. The old system made more sense for mileage. It could at least be an option to have the car cycle the compressor. I realize that they are attempting to deliver air at an exact temperature, but I think it could be accomplished in a smarter fashion."
benjaminh,Jun-14,"I've owned both Mazdas and Hondas in my life. They are my two favorite car brands. You probably can't go wrong imho.
That having been said, I definitely prefer Hondas overall. There's a slightly higher level of engineering and functionality in a Honda compared to any other make at roughly the same price imho. The Accord also has better visibility, better room inside (esp. back seat), more trunk space, etc.
Best wishes either way. I think you've picked the two best cars in the segment."
akirby,Jun-14,"Since almost all modern vehicles work this way now, I'm going to assume that the automotive engineers are smarter than we are and have very good logical reasons for running the compressor. If you prefer to think they're stupid, go right ahead."
[Deleted User],Jun-14,"AHHHH. SO you might know the hills I speak of. They are on 395, built in the 1960's, and it has steep up and down grades that today would be smoothed out. I use my cruise to keep my car from unwanted state and local police attention,
I have some advice for DC visitors. On your way out. of the city, on 395 South,(next to the ugly Marine Corp memorial there is an entrance to 395 South. Do not go over 67 mph, even if it is a difficult merge (it is). The area I speak of it about 1 mile from the Pentagon. A cop waits on a on ramp for folks flooring it to get over into 395 traffic. After driving around DC to visit the sites, and realizing the pavement is terrible, no one cares that you are taking pictures of X memorial or museum, and if you drive slow people may, and do throw things at you. Seriously. Just park and walk. Driving in DC is like playing Russian roulette. The Very best way to see DC on foot is to go in on 23rd street, kept straight , then before F street, make a right. There about 10 spots there with meters.It costs 2 bucks for 2 hours AFTER 9:30 AM (Museums open at 10AM). Now, on 395 N through the city, you can no longer get to Pennsylvania Avenue (RT 50) the old way. They are doing construction that had even me making illegal U-Turns and my GPS does not have these new roads on the map yet, so it thought I was driving in there Anacostia River... which would throw a wrench in my desire to get home,."
[Deleted User],Jun-14,"I wouldn't worry about quality and breakdowns. Which h one makes you feel good when you drive it? Which one is more responsive? Also, I think the Mazda, found in a garage 70 years from now would be a gem, not the other way around. Lastly. Mazda has a real 6 speed. Onoda has cleverly engineered it's CV T to feel like a 6 speed auto... so I would buy the real one rather than wait FRO THE Honda CVT to explode trying to be too many things to too many people."

""2014 Chevrolet Malibu: Better Than Before, But Still Needs More....
So the 2014 Chevrolet Malibu is definitely a step forward from last year's car, and a more recommendable midsize sedan than before. If you love its looks, crave a comfortable and relatively quiet highway ride, it's worth a look. But the Malibu's tight rear seat and so-so fuel economy are easily trumped by other cars in our group."""
benjaminh,Jun-14,"""2014 Ford Fusion SE: Utility, Plus a Little Something Extra....
For everyday driving, the Ford Fusion's sportier personality adapts easily to daily commutes or the long highway miles of a road trip. The interior speaks contemporary without showing off, and the materials are generally on par for this class. The front bucket seats were very supportive. We weren't impressed, however, with the center stack's tiny display or the lack of a backup camera -- we would recommend optioning up to the big-screen Sync/MyFord Touch system, though the system's Bluetooth setup can sometimes be a chore. The Fusion's high beltline is good for styling, but less so for seeing out the sides and rear of this midsize sedan.
Moving further back, the Ford Fusion midsize sedan is not a star-player for rear-seat legroom, although headroom is great. For cargo enthusiasts, the Fusion offers 16.0 cubic feet of trunkspace -- excellent for the class -- and the lowest liftover among our eight competitors."""
benjaminh,Jun-14,"""2014 Honda Accord: It's Good to Be King....
Spirited, fun driving is something the Mazda6 is known for but the Accord held its own in the twisty sections of our route. The Accord also has something the Mazda6 lacks, and that's loads of interior and cargo space. However, while the pass through space is big, we continue to wonder why Honda won't make the move to a split-back rear seat. As noted by multiple editors, the Accord's trunk is cavernous -- one of the biggest in the segment -- and can fit more than a week's worth of groceries for a family of five.
Then there's the incredibly frugal 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine which sipped fuel at an impressively gradual rate during the drive. Paired with a CVT, which is in a class by itself, the Accord EX has no trouble getting up to highway speeds....
Overall, the 2014 Honda Accord EX consistently proved throughout the course of this test that it deserves to sit at the top of the midsize sedan segment. Whether it's the frugal powertrain, comfortable and roomy interior, or the cavernous trunk, the Accord is a solid package."""
benjaminh,Jun-14,"""2014 Kia Optima EX: Lots of Features, Not Lots of Fun....
There's a contemporary and decidedly upscale flair to its basic design and the upgraded front buckets are now notably more comfortable. The Optima's driver-oriented dash layout and highly-legible tri-barrel main instrument cluster also drew kudos as did less-obvious touches like its large central covered storage bin, easily accessible ports/powerpoints, rear-seat A/C vents and trick cooled glovebox.....
While lacking the Accord's level of accelerative enthusiasm, the Optima's 2.4-liter/192-horsepower 4-cylinder engine mated to a 6-speed Sportmatic autoshifter still give this Kia category-competitive straight-line performance. The same does not hold true of the Optima's overall handling, which was deemed least satisfying of the group. A suspension light on meaningful driver feedback coupled with fussy steering that requires frequent mini-corrections detract from an otherwise genuinely impressive midsize-sedan package."""
benjaminh,Jun-14,"""2014 Mazda Mazda6: Sportiness Doesn't Trump Utility....
After our lengthy drive that included stints in seven other top midsize-sedan choices, including the highly popular Toyota Camry and Honda Accord, our jury of testers were nearly unanimous in calling the Mazda6 the most fun-to-drive car of the bunch. Further, we all largely agreed that the dramatic curves of the Mazda6's exterior make it the best-looking car in the group as well. So best-performing and best-looking are nice places to start. Beyond that though, the example of the Mazda6 we tested, which had a manual transmission versus the automatics in the others, was the least expensive of the gathered competitors, and its fuel economy (oddly hindered, not helped by its manual transmission as in days of yore) was up toward the top of the class as well. Yes, there is something to Mazda's highly touted Skyactiv technology suite.
So what are the downsides of the Mazda6 in comparison to the other top midsize-sedan choices in the segment? Some cited what they termed a ""smallish"" rear seat, and one said the entire interior seemed ""cramped."""
benjaminh,Jun-14,"""2014 Nissan Altima 2.5 SV: Solid Alternative to the Mainstream....
There's a few reasons why the 2014 Nissan Altima is not, however, a midsize-sedan segment leader. The first is that its design is, quite frankly, a little anonymous. The body lines flow nicely, but the grille and overall appearance is not as cutting edge as other designs from Nissan, like the newly updated Murano. Of course, the same can be said for the Toyota Camry, however, that car has a mid-cycle refresh coming in short order. The good news for Nissan fans is that the next Altima will be more distinctive, much in the way of the bold looking concept that is purported to be the next Maxima.
The growly 182-horsepower 4-cylinder engine in our test vehicle provided adequate power for a car in this class, and the continuously variable transmission actually mimics shifts like a conventional automatic in some instances, which makes for a more familiar driving feel. The Altima's handling is composed, and some editors put it third behind the Mazda6 and Ford Fusion in pure driving enjoyment. Of course, steering feel is subjective and one comment complained of steering that could have been more precise. But in day-to-day use, the Altima midsize sedan comes across as controlled and comfortable. The front bucket seats were supportive and easy to settle into with 6-way adjustment."""
benjaminh,Jun-14,"""2014 Toyota Camry: Old Guys Rule....
None of the editors had anything nice to say about the Camry's design sense, but ""don't care for the dash/center stack design or the steering wheel controls"" was as harsh as it got. ""Generic styling"" was another direct quote and captured the overall sentiment.
Yes, there are sexier, cooler, more fun-to-drive midsize sedans on the market, but the Camry hasn't duped its way into the best-seller's spot. An affordable, reliable, comfortable way to move about the world, the Camry is exactly the car so many shoppers seek."""
stevedebi,Jun-14,"The engineers are not stupid. The wrong end result was programmed into their thought process; it did not include the question as to which is better - using less gas while keeping a nearly accurate temperature, or having the exact temperature. The only result they are building for is exact temperature control. They are focusing on keeping the exact temperature dialed in, which requires exact control of the air. The easiest way to do that is to keep the cold air from the compressor constantly running and then raise the incoming temperature using the engine heat. Sure, the temperature is exact, but does it really need to be that exact? I think it does in fact use more fuel, which is my basic point. The engineering logic is needlessly precise.
I hope they may eventually get the idea it is better to cycle the compressor. In my experience the auto temperature settings are not really as efficient or accurate as they are intended, due to differences in the cabin windows vs the sun position, etc. So I think the input controls don't really provide the degree of precision they were thinking anyway. But once an idea takes hold it tends to stay on a long time. That federal mandate of a fleet average MPG of 54 may lead to some expanded thinking."
akirby,Jun-14,"The 54 mpg fleet average tests don't use the HVAC at all so it won't have any effect.
Running the A/C does not allow the temperature to be more precisely controlled - you can do that in the winter with just the heater.
It's done specifically to dehumidify the air. It shuts off just above 32 degrees because at that point there isn't enough moisture in the air to require dehumidification."
[Deleted User],Jun-14,"Yep. That about sums it up. But if you sit in traffic most of the time handling really isn't an issue. It is one of the reasons that I am considering coilovers.... but somehow I don't think it will be worth it. If I have to sit in traffic, I would rather have a good stereo. The subs (take up no usable space) and kicker AMP are in, and the Alpine 6.5"" speakers will be here tomorrow."
berri,Jun-14,"I understand Toyota putting generous promo's on the soon to be changed Camry, but did you notice there is 0%/60 and $1500 on Ford Fusion and I just saw an ad on TV for Hyundai with 0%/72 and $2000. Those are new designs. Competition must be brutal right now."
ab348,Jun-14,"Hyundai is only about moving the metal at any cost. I don't know if a dumping charge takes into account financing rates but I presume it might. They must be really close to that with all those incentives on a brand new, if disappointing, redesign."
stickguy,Jun-14,"wow. that much on the ones just coming out? will have to check about that. The Fusion, that I can believe.
My neighbor is a ford Salesman, and has had the same demo for a while that I assume is for sale (has one of those warranty disclosure statements in the window now too). I am real curious what they would take for it, and what incentives apply.
it is a white 2014 SE. 2.5L (no turbos), with IIRC a package that includes a back up cam and heated seats. Plus it has a moonroof, alloys and power seats. So basically, the simple version that has all the required stuff, and nothing extraneous. MSRP is just over 25K."

[Deleted User],Jul-14,"Well, it looks exactly the same as the old one. Decent rental at the airport, but I don't see how it makes people WANT one. The interior looks the same as the last 2 previous models. No thanks.

ab348,Jul-14,"You know, Chevy can make cars that are desirable. The Impala is way nicer looks wise and has a 305 HP 6 cyl..
The Malibu is an inexcusable effort by GM. The platform it is built on is the same as my Regal, which is a great car. The problem isn't the handling or the engines. It is everything else. The styling is terrible, the interior design is a joke, and the value proposition is just not there. Everything about it is unattractive. It is just a very unhappy design. They need to scrap this one ASAP and start fresh."
stevedebi,Jul-14,"You are correct about winter, of course. They don't need to cool the air with the compressor when it is cool outside. However in summer it is needed to make sure there is cold air to blend. Being from the southwest, I think in terms of the heat more than the cold, and I get better MPG in the winter (in general), partially because I don't have to run the A/C.
Good point about the fleet average, if they don't use the A/C in the testing..."

akirby,Jul-14,But the question is whether those are pull ahead sales due to discounts on the old model or people who don't like the new one buying the old one now?
stickguy,Jul-14,"I think if you stop at the dealer for an oil change (heck, to use the bathroom) they will give you a Camry on the way out the door. Just, because."
backy,Jul-14,"Re sales figures... people rave over the huge sales numbers of the Camry, but don't tend to notice that Hyundai/Kia's mid-sizers are only about 1600 units behind the Camry. The Sonata's numbers last month were no doubt fueled by close-out deals on the 2014s, but even in more typical months the Sonata/Optima duo is pretty close to the top sellers. Given their real-world pricing isn't much different in most months from cars like the Camry, Altima, and Fusion, they must be doing something right to attract so many buyers in an ultra-competitive marketplace. And that's with the oldest designs of any in the class, save the Legacy (2015 coming) and the woeful Avenger."
explorerx4,Jul-14,"Got the Fusion back today. After having the Altima for 2 weeks, which was great on gas, and has a heavier feel, the Fusion feels like it is 500 pounds lighter not probably 500 more. I am sticking by my original impression the that Altima is a good long distance cruiser. Corner carver, not so much. Maybe better tires would fix that.
Could be a setting, but despite having a proximity type key and push button start, I had to actually start the Altima in order to say open or close the windows or check the info display. With the Fusion, I can just push the start button to activate the electrics."

ab348,Jul-14,"I rolled through the local Toyota dealer lot when they were closed on Sunday and was surprised to see a pair of 2013 Camry Hybrid leftovers on display on the raised plaza out front of their showroom. One was a fairly anonymous dark gray in color, but the other was a rather striking blue metallic, not quite light blue and not quite medium blue. I believe it is called ""Clearwater Blue"". I have never seen one in that paint color before and found it quite attractive, especially with the light interior color it sported. But I wonder if that is the reason it has not sold? Most people seem not to like vibrant colors these days, at least on sedans. I wonder, too, with these being nearly 2 model years old, why they haven't cleared them out."

brian125,Jul-14,Mark my words the new 2015 Passat will triple in sales. Write it down Benjaminh for the record..
brian125,Jul-14,"The main advantage of the new generation VW Passat is a new Volkswagen’s EA288 2.0L TDI engine. It develops 150 hp and 320 Nm of torque per second. The model equipped with this engine has EPA ratings of 31 mpg city and 43 mpg hwy. Next diesel engines on offer are: 1.8L turbocharged diesel engine with four-cylinder rated at 170 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque, and 24 mpg city/34 mpg hwy and 3.6 V6 engine with 280 hp and 265 lb-ft of torque. It offers 2015 VW Passat to exceed 20 mpg city/28 mpg hwy. Gasoline engines offer will include the 1.4 TSI with 125 hp, and the 2.0 TSI with 279 hp. Such a great offer turbocharged engines with direct injection, should meet the needs of different markets in which 2015 VW Passat will be offered. All engines are mated to a 6-speed manual or automatic transmission. DSG will be available option. And AWD is standard
The new Passat will be the largest vehicle to date, set to the modular MQB platform. The new platform has enabled the reduction of the entire vehicle weight by as much as 220 pounds. Dimensions Passat B8 are almost identical to its predecessor. Only 2 cm longer. Wheelbase is 10 cm higher.
New design lines are taken from the existing CC model. It will have the greatest positive impact on the aerodynamic performance of the vehicle. Not giving up its distinctive VW sedan design, the last Golf model also could have an impact to the look of the new Passat model.
If someone could find and post a pic of the 2015 Passat to show . I don't know how to bring picture over here. Nice sleek looking front would have to see it in person for better judgment."
benjaminh,Jul-14,"Why do you think the 2015 Passat will triple? What changes are being made? I think it's a good car now, actually, and I'm puzzled it's not selling better."
brian125,Jul-14,"All around better vehicle than previous years. The Passat has been plagued with reliability problems ho- hum styling, below average acceleration and resale value. This will be a big jump for the Passat. The new improved motors will be a homerun for VW ........ Write it down."
stevedebi,Jul-14,"The 1.8 is a gas engine, I believe. And unless they are changing things, I don't think the TDI is available with a stick."
explorerx4,Jul-14,Passat is not selling because it looks like a mid 90's Caprice.
stevedebi,Jul-14,"Funny you say that, because the looks were the first thing I liked. The second was the back seat, and the third was the MPG."

ivan_99,Jul-14,"In half an hour I'm going out to lunch with a colleague who drives a 2012 TDI 6M. It's just about 2 years old, which isn't really that indicative of reliability, but has had zero problems.
It's in amazing condition everything has held up well (in this limited time) with no signs of wear and tear (looks new). He always achieves higher than the EPA even though he drives aggressively (torque = awesome).
I too really like the looks; classy and refined. Not certain I'd place it at the top of my design list, but definitely not the bottom."
brian125,Jul-14,"The 2015 redesign model is so much nicer than the P-b8 posted above. check out either spy shots or google 15 Passat.

Vw has to make sure the quality of this vehicle stays on par with its class leaders. The new motor choice's will help this model. I would think the Manuel's will be a lot of fun to drive. I like the look of the new Passat. Nice clean lines. Don't think it will appeal to the younger generation kids. Just my 2 cents.

stevedebi,Jul-14,"Right you are! That VW site is confusing. I finally found it as ""available"". The VW dealer didn't have any in stock.
EDIT: OK, that is why I didn't see one. The stick is only available on the SE, not the higher trims."
nyccarguy,Jul-14,The new look VW website is terrible
gogophers1,Jul-14,"I just noticed that Ford has the build configurator up on their website now for the 2015 Fusion. And, oh boy, does the news look bad for the row team: there's no way to build the SE anymore w/a manual transmission. I hope I'm missing something here - the order guide they released to dealers in May still had the manual listed as an option. Perhaps this is a last minute/cost cutting change (eliminating the stick option drops the 1.6 from the build sheets)? If so, I guess my potential choices in the midsize class just dropped to two: the 6 and the Accord and the 6 isn't configurable w/a sunroof so..."
akirby,Jul-14,It is in the order guide as you mentioned but not on the website. Maybe they decided to drop the 1.6 early and the 1.5L manual combo isn't tested yet.
backy,Jul-14,"Another option you might consider is a Jetta GLI with a stick. Interior and trunk-wise it's very close if not bigger than some mid-sizers. Also the new 2015 Passat may offer a stick with sunroof, not sure about that."
benjaminh,Jul-14,"Honda Accord EX has a standard sunroof/moonroof, and is available with a 6MT. Finding one, however, won't be easy...."
gogophers1,Jul-14,"None of the midsize stick choices were perfect (Honda makes you forgo satellite radio and limits buyers to two bland color options when they check the stick box, Mazda blocks both the sunroof AND satellite radio when opting for the manual), but I liked the Ford the best (styling, handling and standard keypad entry on the SE trim). Passats aren't available with both the stick and sunroof either, and, keeping with recent VW tradition, are only available with vinyl seating (blech) on the midlevel trimlines. I'm also not a fan of the ""styling"" of the Passat. I don't mind the Jetta but I think it's overpriced when optioned and I still don't trust the reliability of any VW wearing a Jetta badge.
The Golf wagon would potentionally be a possibility (still a few months out) but I'm sure it will be an all vinyl affair too."
brian125,Jul-14,Just seen a ad for the Sonata. 4th weekend giving a additional 2500 off in incentives. ``On top of there other incentives. Not a bad deal probably could walk away with one for 20% plus off the MSRP on any Sonata.

plekto,Jul-14,"None of the midsize stick choices were perfect (Honda makes you forgo satellite radio and limits buyers to two bland color options when they check the stick box,
I did some checking and it looks like there isn't an entry-level car(small) forum or a sports car forum or a convertible or coupe forum to speak of. So basically everything that's not a SUV, Truck, or entry-level luxury sedans gets tossed in here as there are no other real options.
Sport, entry, coupe, and basic all returned zero forum name hits. It looks like quite literally there is ""Midsize Sedans"" and ""Entry-Level Performance Sedans"" and nothing else.
If you look beyond just midsize 4 door sedans, your options for manual transmission cars greatly increases.
Note - it's also why I routinely go outside the ""box"" - because there isn't another forum for those types of cars."
brian125,Jul-14,No you should of said ..................... You saw the Ad I seen.
akirby,Jul-14,Should've not should of. Sorry......
gogophers1,Jul-14,"Certainly there are other options out there if one requires a manual transmission (compact sedans, performance coupes, and the Acura TSX and BMW 2/3 series to name a few), I just would prefer a midsize sedan for its practicality and value. I feel like I'm too old for a compact now (at 38) - they don't have enough room (and don't possess the image I need to present in my profession); performance coupes, again, lack room and they're a pain to drive in urban areas with heavy traffic; the Acura TSX could be an option but it's got a tiny trunk and backseat (and I think it's being eliminated from Acura's line-up) and the baby Bimmers start getting expensive once a person starts equipping them like the avg. ENTRY level midsize car (add satellite radio, a sunroof and metallic paint and you're looking at close to a $40K ride - with vinyl seats!)... $40K is a heckuva lot of money to throw on a depreciating asset for a guy who's still paying a mortgage."
backy,Jul-14,"There IS an entry-level car forum here, although it hasn't had any activity for awhile--feel free to get it going again!
forums.edmunds.com/discussion/1973/toyota/aveo/low-end-sedans-under-16k#latest
Of course, one option for a mid-sized sedan with a stick is to get a gently used one, since in recent years sticks have nearly disappeared. And if one goes the gently used route, it's possible to pick up an entry luxury sedan with a stick for the same money as a new mid-sized sedan."
benjaminh,Jul-14,"A new choice in midsize?
Acura is just about to introduce the ""all-new"" 2015 TLX, starting at $30,995. Yes, I know this thread is about standard midsize cars, and not entry-level ""near luxury"" cars like this one, but at this price the Acura TLX really is competitive with several midsize cars that when optioned up list for something close to this. I would call this pricing either ""aggressive"" or desperate depending on how you look at it.
Anyway, a 4-cylinder EXL Accord, for instance, has an msrp of $28,270. Setting aside for the moment the large discounts you can get on the Accord, getting an Acura for less than $3000 more might be worth considering.
Why?
Well, Acura certainly doesn't have the prestige of BMW, Audi, MB, etc., but still puts you a cut above the nearly 400,000 people a year who buy Accords.
In terms of what you actually get for that money compared to the Accord, here are a few things....
-more horsepower (206 compared to 185), although you have to use premium fuel
-all-new 8 speed dual clutch transmission (compared to the Accord's CVT, which actually I love)
-Premium interior compared with the Accord
-longer warranty
-4 wheel steering that apparently is quite good
-""jewel eye"" led headlights
-better sound system
-etc.
For someone looking at a high-end regular midsize car, it might be worth thinking about. When I'm next in the market I might give it a test drive.

brian125,Jul-14,"Acura TSX / Acura TLX
The TSX is definitely more in line with the mid size cars we speak of in here price wise. Overall this vehicle not quiet as good thou. With the Acura tsx ratings and reviews that I posted below from Edmunds I don't think this vehicle will ever compete with The Accords , Camrys, or Fusions..
The Acura 2015, TLX is for sure a step up in class and vehicle. I would consider buying this car if I want a loaded Accord. or Fusion. Buying either model puts you in the 32/ 33k range in price OTD.. The Acura TLX, starts at 31k with the smaller motor offered. Now I'm entering in a much higher price range where you have the Lexus ES 350, Avalon, and Genesis. All very good choices depending on your needs and how much you want to spend. A loaded TLX is almost 45k. Inline with the 3 cars mentioned.
Review of the 2014 Acura TSX
Although the 2014 Acura TSX is still a respectable choice for an entry-level luxury sedan, it's starting to fall behind in key areas and ultimately isn't as compelling as some rivals.
Safety | Reliability
Pros
Pleasing amount of standard equipment; spacious interior; sporty handling on V6 model; excellent build and materials quality.
Cons
Unimpressive braking performance; lackluster acceleration and fuel economy; can't be equipped with certain desirable technology features.
What's New for 2014
The 2014 Acura TSX returns unchanged."
gogophers1,Jul-14,"I like the peace of mind that comes from having a new car under warranty.
Back when I was buying used cars (in the '90s), it was hard enough to find a midsize stickshift w/anything near how I'd want it equipped (and I was open to the Legacy, Galant, Accord, Altima, Passat AND Camry at the time). God only knows how difficult that same endeavor would be today.
The days of the stickshift are going away for good; I'd like to get one last thrill (before we're all herded onto public transportation and forced to live in Swedish Walking Flats along designated commuter routes)."
suydam,Jul-14,"Umm, it's in the countries that have public transportation where stick shift cars are more common. Since we don't, and thus have to drive a lot more, we like to be comfy. That aside and back to the subject, probably the Mazda or Accord are your best choices."
brian125,Jul-14,"The only country in the world where stick shifts aren't popular is the USA, where most cars instead have automatic transmissions.
Until recently, cars with stick shifts got better MPG than cars with automatic transmissions, and since gas costs much more in most places outside the USA, people preferred using a stick. Sticks are also simpler and cheaper to make.
In most newer cars, engineering has improved and there isn't any significant MPG difference between the two types of transmissions. But since countries that used stick shifts are used to them, they continue to be popular.
Some people also prefer stick shifts because they do give you more control over the car; I've had both types of cars and I agree with that, but I prefer an automatic because it's less work."
explorerx4,Jul-14,"Re: TLX, Premium fuel and lackluster fuel mileage ratings are not going to help it. Plus they kept the front styling that most people don't seem to like. The 8 speed DCT is a potentially good feature."
benjaminh,Jul-14,"The TLX is rated 28 mpg overall with the 2.4. That's the same as the smaller BMW 320i, which costs a lot more comparably equipped. And I'm pretty sure almost all ""near luxury"" cars require premium fuel.
There are diesels and hybrids that get higher mpg, but I don't know of any midsize ""near luxury"" car that uses gas that's higher than 28 mpg combined. But maybe I'm missing something?
I do like the rather sci-fi James Bond look of the pushbutton transmission in the TLX. Overall, the interior looks very nice to me. Some people (including me) have said that the current Accord when you get an EXL and above is almost an ""Acura Accord."" The TLX establishes considerable distance between the Accord and the TLX in interior design."
explorerx4,Jul-14,"@benjaminh, I missed the numbers for the 2.4. I thought the 21/34/25 was for that engine. Still requires premium fuel, which gives back the mileage gains. The current Accord has a very plain interior, but I guess it all depends on what you are used to."
m6user,Jul-14,"I just saw a review of the new 1.5l ecoboost Fusion SE and the reviewer had the car for a week and averaged 23.5mpg. Now that is what I would call lackluster. If the new TLX can get at or close to it's EPA estimates, which Honda and Acura have a good history of doing, it certainly wouldn't be considered ""lackluster"". Where does that statement even come from other than just plain bashing? Plus, who knows if the 2.4 will even require premium. My '13 Acura RDX doesn't. To my knowledge, the specs on fuel have not been published yet for the TLX but I haven't really did any research on it either."
brian125,Jul-14,lackluster fuel is noted on the smaller 2014 model TSX........ not the 2015 TLX
m6user,Jul-14,I was referring to explorerx4 post when he referred to the TLX having lackluster mpg and premium fuel.
explorerx4,Jul-14,"If anyone finds an Acura that doesn't recommend premium fuel, let me know.
The numbers are based on 91 octane.
My Fusion is tuned to make more power on premium, but since I'm averaging 4 mpg over the EPA combined mileage and it has plenty of power, I don't feel there is any reason to use premium.
Here is a pic of some new and old
https://us.v-cdn.net/5021145/uploads/editor/w9/kxlcgwskdkvy.jpg"
m6user,Jul-14,"You originally said ""premium required"". Are you now changing it to ""premium recommended""? My Acura is premium recommended but regular runs just fine. I think Ford also recommends premium for optimal performance in their ecoboost engines if I recall correctly but regular runs fine as well. The Lexus ES350 and RX350 are both regular gas and premium is not even recommended."
explorerx4,Jul-14,"I took the post by benjaminh as fact. My mistake. Numbers are still based on premium fuel, so what is going to suffer mileage or power? On RUG the 2.4 will probably make the same power as the Accord."
m6user,Jul-14,"I just haven't seen anything written about what fuel the 2.4 is supposed to use but I would agree with you that it is probably at least ""premium recommended"". I've never seen a real power comparison on the RDX 3.5 running on regular vs. premium. I assume there is some degradation in power but I don't think it's a whole lot. I use midgrade in mine all the time and it shoots when I want it to."
benjaminh,Jul-14,"Acura cars in the past have at least strongly suggested premium fuel iirc.
The Acura engine is a bit souped up compared to the Accord's engine, but you are probably right that on regular the power drops close to the Accord level. But I'd say the Accord's is one of the nicest and most advanced engines in any midsize....
In terms of the interior of the Accord, here's what Edmunds says in its review:
""With a few exceptions, the materials in the 2014 Honda Accord have a high-quality look and feel. The overall cockpit design is elegant, and the cabin's tight construction gives the impression of an entry-level luxury car...."""
wayne21,Jul-14,"Infiniti requires the use of premium fuel and clearly states that not using it will void the warranty. Here is what the 2014 Acura TL owner's manual says about fuel requirements:
Your vehicle is designed to operate on premium unleaded gasoline with a pump octane of 91 or higher. If this octane grade is unavailable, regular unleaded gasoline with a pump octane of 87 or higher may be used temporarily. The use of regular unleaded gasoline can cause metallic knocking noises in the engine and will result in decreased engine performance. The long-term use of regular-grade gasoline can lead to engine damage."
plekto,Jul-14,"So about what midsize car you can get with manual...
There are four main choices here. The Honda Accord, the Ford Fusion, the Acura TSX and the VW Passat.
The Honda Accord is the lowest and most basic of the four because the manual is only available in the most basic trim model. There is a sport version, but it's overpriced bling (does nothing for the handling) and in any case, you get black or silver-gray as you only paint options. $21K for a car that looks like a cheap rental, with absolutely no options available. It's a shame, really, as the models with automatic are quite nice by comparison.
The next up the line is the Fusion. The manual is available on their mid-trim SE model only. You would have to special order it, but it does make the car quite nice to drive. The downside, though, is that the car has a very small engine that while it does the job quite well, is not going to impress anyone with its speed. That said, it is a nice looking and driving car.
The TSX was sold in Japan as the Accord until recently. What we get as the ""Accord"" over here is an odd in-between car, which is why it feels a little lacking. The current TSX is a new design based off of the old one, so it's basically the real deal and Honda's mainstream family sedan in the rest of the world. The downside is the price isn't very attractive any more. At almost $10K more than the Fusion or Accord, it's a lot to swallow, IMO. Still, $32K isn't $40K.
I rate the Passat as the best value for the money of the four and the best handling. Basically it's an Audi A4 without the bling. It'll run you typically $25K for one, nicely optioned out. I like the driving position and layout a bit better than the TSX, though it's not as well optioned or as plush inside. Then again, there is a $7K or so price difference, so that's to be expected. There also is a TDI option, which with manual is fun to drive and gets hybrid MPG without all of the batteries and stuff to eventually break."
benjaminh,Jul-14,"You can still get an Accord EX cloth with a 6 speed manual. It's missing a few things, but it's quite nice for the c. $25k msrp. Includes moonroof, smart entry/pushbutton start, lanewatch, 17"" alloys, 10-way power seat, etc.
And, although clearly it doesn't work for you, the Accord Sport has been called by some the best value on the new car market. The 18"" premium tires and wheels are certainly ""bling,"" but I think maybe a few tests have shown that there is a slight advantage in terms of cornering.
And the LX Accord with the 6-speed is a bargain. LX is no longer a ""stripper"" model but actually has a very nice level of equipment, including alloys, back up camera, dual zone climate control, etc."
m6user,Jul-14,"You could get the Mazda6 touring as well for a street price of $23k or less which includes the following:
SKYACTIV-MT 6-Speed manual transmission, Dual-zone automatic climate control, 19-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, 6-way power driver's seat, Mazda Advanced Keyless Entry, Multi-function Commander control, Rear seat heat and A/C vents, Leatherette-trimmed seats, Blind Spot Monitoring System, Rear Cross Traffic Alert"
stickguy,Jul-14,"well, if you hurry, the 2014 Legacy base comes with a stick. Looks like the redesigned 2015 eliminated that though."
m6user,Jul-14,"wayne21
Before you go out and do more research and copy and paste several manuals from luxury cars, let's just agree that MOST luxury or near luxury cars either require or recommend premium gas. I was specifically referring to the Acura RDX because I have one and know what the manual says and it says that 87octane is fine but you will get a little better performance with premium. It recommends premium, not require it. The TL is different. The two Lexus I referenced are kind of the exceptions in that they don't even recommend premium. I know what Infiniti requires because that's what I had before the Acura. My whole point was just that the statement was made that ALL luxury cars require premium fuel and that is just not the case. It was also inferred that all Acuras require premium fuel and that is just not the case either.
I don't like to buy premium anymore than anyone else if I don't have to. I can certainly afford it but unless spending extra cash really gets me something that I really want I just consider it foolish to do so. A couple of extra horsepower which I might only use on the rare occassion that I really get on it is simply not worth the extra expense to me. That's why I buy midgrade, kind of a compromise."
benjaminh,Jul-14,"That's a pretty great deal on a great car. What's the msrp?
Mazda's Skyactiv includes some very impressive engineering. It also has the highest mpg of any midsize manual iirc. Beats the Accord by a few mpg city and highway."
m6user,Jul-14,"benjaminh said: ""The Acura engine is a bit souped up compared to the Accord's engine, but you are probably right that on regular the power drops close to the Accord level. But I'd say the Accord's is one of the nicest and most advanced engines in any midsize....""
Don't really understand why you think the Acura engine is souped up compared to the Accords'.
Acura RDX 3.5L is 273hp at 6200rpm, 251 ft lbs at 5000
Accord 3.5L is 278hp at 6200rpm, 252ft lbs at 4900
Acura has less hp and less torque. If anything the Accord is souped up. There is a lot of debate on the Acura forums as to why Acura is even recommending premium on this engine when the Accord and Odyssey engines are basically the same and obviously don't recommend premium."
m6user,Jul-14,"The MSRP on the Mazda6 Touring w/stick is about $24,900. But street price, which you referred to on the Accord, is probably more like $22-23k."
wayne21,Jul-14,"@m6user - was lending credibility to the post. Question on your acura - do you notice wind noise? I'm considering the TLX when it comes out, but our accord had a lot of wind noise and when I do my googles it seems as though Honda motor company has had wind noise issues going all the way back to the 1976 accord."
benjaminh,Jul-14,"I think Honda and Acura have finally gotten the memo on wind and road noise. Our 2008 Accord has a lot of both. But our 2013 Accord, in contrast, has a quiet and pleasant ride.
My bet is that the 2015 Acura TLX will be very quiet, since they obviously have to top the now-impressive Accord on that score."
benjaminh,Jul-14,"I was thinking of the 2.4. On the Accord it's rated 185, while on the new TLX I think it's been modified a bit so that with premium fuel it gets 206. Hadn't checked the 3.5, since I'm not interested in it for mpg reasons—plus it's out of my price range. I'm surprised, however, that it's lower than the Accord!"
m6user,Jul-14,"@wayne21
Well, you have to consider that our other cars are an older Mazda6 and a Tundra.....both not known for a super quiet ride. However, I've taken the RDX on a couple of trips to Michigan and back and haven't been bothered by wind noise at all. Having said that, I sometimes crank up the volume on road trips so the ELS system in the Acura may very well cover up some noise. It has some kind of active sound deadening which I have no idea how it works. But to answer your question, unless you're really sensitive(or picky LOL) to it, I would say it's fine."
suydam,Jul-14,I have the '13 Accord EX-L CVT. Much different than in the past with regards to noise levels. A very quiet ride and great road trip car.
wayne21,Jul-14,"@m6user ""But to answer your question, unless you're really sensitive(or picky LOL) to it, I would say it's fine"".... could be the issue. I've driven our friends new accord (4 cyl exl) and the wind noise on the b pillar was so obvious to me, but neither he nor his wife heard anything. Last week, I went to lunch with an old friend in his new odyssey (the one with the vacuum cleaner). He's in his 70s, but we both heard wind noise. He said it was quiet until it got about 6,000 miles on it - at which point the wind noise started."
m6user,Jul-14,"@wayne21‌
You know wind noise is present to some degree in every car at higher speeds and, like you said, some people are just more sensitive or bothered by it than others. I don't think it bothers me all that much or I probably wouldn't have purchased the Mazda6 originally. If you are, then I would never take anyone's word for it. If I was interested in a vehicle I would just go test drive it and make sure I got it up to high speed and tell the salesman to STFU so you can really hear the nuances of the vehicle noise. Cause I could tell you it sounds like a tomb and you could say it sounds like your on a 737 getting ready for take off! We would both be right."
stickguy,Jul-14,"I also have a 2013 RDX. I travel a lot with it, and IMO the wind noise is very muted. I'm sure you can hear some if you concentrate on it, but nothing intrusive, or that would drown out the radio or conversation.
I also have a 2000 TL, and find that to be quiet, as was the 2005 Accord I used to have. At least in terms of wind noise, but you do get some tire noise on certain road surfaces (that is a Honda tradition!)"
plekto,Jul-14,"I forgot about the Mazda. It's also a better choice than the Accord (and possibly the Fusion as well). The issue that I have with the Accord with manual is the lack of options, two terrible color choices, and a higher price for what you get than the competition. Is it good, yes. Is it clearly a penalty/stripper car that's trying to make you choose the automatic model with the better options? Of course it is. It's an old old trick to do this to make more money on the ""better"" car with automatic.
It's one of my pet peeves when you have to get the most basic model to get the manual. If I was living in Europe or Canada buying the exact same car, I certainly wouldn't be treated like some idiot by the auto maker.
Cloth and a choice between silver and steel for paint colors. For $25K. Are you sure this isn't GM?"
benjaminh,Jul-14,"Some dislike for Honda here?
How many manuals are left in the midsize market? Mazda, Honda, Ford, and VW iirc. They've died pretty much everywhere else. I give all of these manufacturers credit for keeping it alive (barely).
In terms of ""options"" Honda has never done that, going back to the 1970s. They do trim levels. Why? It simplifies manufacturing a little and thus raises quality.
And at this point the Accord doesn't really have a stripper model. As mentioned, even the LX has a lot of stuff standard that some of the competition doesn't have, like standard backup camera, alloys, dual zone climate, smart phone integration, etc.
Back in 2008 I was able to get an Accord EXL Navi with a manual. Had to special order it, but it was possible. But as everyone knows, the manual is dying, and so its availability is more limited now.
In terms of picking the Mazda6 manual over a Honda Accord manual that's a matter of taste and priories.
For faster acceleration times the manual Accord seems to be the choice. Car and driver has the manual Accord going 0-60 in 6.6 seconds. Some tests show the Mazda6 manual at about a second more. That's a significant difference.
The Accord is also superior to the Mazda6 in terms of: rear seat room, trunk space, visibility, etc.
And since there are a lot more Honda dealers than Mazda dealers, and Honda sells a heck of a lot more than Mazda, service and parts are easier to come by.
Most publications give the edge to the Mazda6 in terms of handling.
The EPA gives the edge to the Mazda6 manual for city/hwy combined mpg, but it's not a big difference: 29 for the Mazda6 manual compared to 28 for the Accord manual.
They are both good choices. Good cases can be made both ways."
benjaminh,Jul-14,"Car and Driver on the Accord Sport manual, which is on their 10-best list:
“The Accord Sport is still a more gratifying car to heel-and-toe shift than most sports cars you could mention.”
""A six-speed Accord Sport sedan for $24,505 rates as the best all-around value for a new car, period.""
And discounts of c. $2k off of msrp are possible.

Again, the Mazda6 is a good choice too, but don't write off the Accord manual. Maybe try a test drive?"
backy,Jul-14,"MT (July 2014) on the Mazda6's and Accord Sport's interior:
""If there's one thing most judges would change about the Mazda6, it would be the interior design. While the exterior styling was unanimously loved, many felt the cabin didn't receive the same amount of love from Mazda designers. 'The interior design is more conservative and cut-and-paste, a la other Mazda models,' said Martinez. Evans echoed, 'The interior is rather dark and boring. Needs some life.' Still, the Mazda had one of the largest back seats in the group by the factory-supplied measurements (subjective butt-on-bench ratings placed it third behind Accord and Altima), and ergonomics were a strong point.""
""The Accord was similarly lambasted, despite its hugely roomy interior. From Lieberman's notepad: 'I didn't really care for the interior. The white polka dots on black plastic seemed particularly poor to me. Looks-wise, there's not much there.' Burgess also wasn't impressed, saying, 'There's a lot of hard plastic throughout the cabin, and it feels like one of the cheaper models overall.' Another annoyance: The Accord was the only car in the group to have a single-piece rear folding seat, rather than a split design.""
I find the single-piece folding rear seat on the Accord, here in 2014, to be inexcusable. Heck, even my lowly Kia Rio has a split-folding rear seat! It also has a lot of hard plastic in the interior, but it's only a $16k car, not a $25k car like the Accord Sport that MT tested."
suydam,Jul-14,Polka dots?
dudleyr,Jul-14,"The Accord EX is pretty evenly matched w/ the Mazda6 touring equipment wise. If anything the nod goes to the Accord with the sunroof. Not really a penalty car. The I4 Accord has 3 versions with a stick. LX, Sport and EX. Only the EXL is off the list. So three out of 4 models is not really just the stripper model. In reality they left it off of just the ""fluffer"".
Now I agree that Honda should offer the stick on all of them, and I am not a huge fan of leaving a stick off of the top model, but they all do it."
explorerx4,Jul-14,I'm with the 96 percent who don't see a reason the buy a mid size sedan with a stick. Something smaller or a powerful coupe is something I would consider buying with a manual transmission.
ab348,Jul-14,"No, because GM doesn't do that. It was Honda who began the practice of only offering 3-5 colors on most models, no choice of interior, take it or leave it. And the public bought them in droves anyway.
And for the record, in Canada, Honda offers you a grand total of 3 colors on the LX manual, black, silver or gray, all with a gray cloth interior. On the Sport they strangely also offer it in blue or white, but drop the silver, all with a black interior."

You know, I have Sirius and never ever use or pay for it. Navigation? I don't know about you, but I have a Garmin Nuvi and a Samsung S3 for directions.
I think it is an attractive, 4 door sedan that exactly targets its buyers. ""cheap rental""? I think you are driving an LX, not a Sport."
berri,Jul-14,"I think Plekto is just stating he'd like to see higher end availability with stick shifts rather than being stuck in the lower end models to get it.

The old Yukon (XL) never had a chance of fitting in the garage at this house, so we left it out and I shoved all the stuff to one side and parked my new Accord inside. When we sold it and got her Pathfinder (I've never had two new cars at the same time before), I decided this was going to happen. So the wheelbarrow and a large deck box for kids' stuff went to the back yard. Installed 24' of Rubbermaid FastTrack with a couple dozen hooks for bikes, tools, chairs, sports equipment, etc., and 12' of shelving for Xmas decorations and camping gear.
It's not at all ""roomy"" with both cars in, and one has to back out to get the kids' bikes, or lawn equipment off the wall. I'd also like some more racks suspended from the ceiling, and maybe a shed in the back yard too, to really open things up and make room for a workbench. But I am very satisfied for now."

[Deleted User],Jul-14,"Then your choices are limited to low end and high end. You can get a Mazda 6 Sport i , Honda Accord Sport (my choice), or a wheezing 1.8 liter 170 HP turbo Passat. Also, you may be able to get. 2.0 liter Passat w/ 220HP in a stick. Now that would be nice. Also, don't dismiss the Golf GTI. Good car. Also, why not a babied 2007 BMW E46 model. You can get a inline 6 with 235 HP, no turbo, and it is the preferred car for BMW enthusiasts since it has NO 4 CYLINDER, no (hated) start-stop system, now, you CAN have that start-stop software disabled at the BMW shop permanently), and a great 6 speed manual. You can pick one up for $25,000. Seriously. The 2007 is the best BMW in my book.
Other than that, drive a BMW or Audi..... or a Nissan Performance product called the Versa. I hear they are great! (Kidding)
Also, you could choose the 320i BMW that will not break the bank, has a 2.0 Turbo engine,180 HP, 200 lb Ft, and can easily boosted back to 240 HP and 250 lb Ft with a firmware upgrade. The zero to 60 time on that $32k BMW is 6.5 seconds, easily passing my 200 HP, 186 lb Ft with 1.5 seconds faster than mine and I bet $29,999 would seal the seal, but mane sure to buy the $1300 ""M"" performance pack, that included 18"" rims, and various bushings, bearings, and anti roll bar settings that really make things fun in the 320i. Again, I can't afford a new Turbo-charged 4 cyl 328, but the 2007 is my favorite model. More of a purists model. Also, it is the very best of the 3.0 liter in-line 6, and I would get the 6 speed manual. This would be my ""second car"" if I had a garage, or $25,000, and a very very good friend that is a BMW master mechanic."
benjaminh,Jul-14,"As cski says, the BMW 320i is compelling. It's grown and is now 182.5 inches long, which is almost the size of a Honda Accord in c. 1995 (184 inches)."
m6user,Jul-14,You are not limited to the low end with the Mazda6. Touring model is available with stick.
benjaminh,Jul-14,"The thing about a 320i is that BMW charges extra for a lot of stuff that's standard on others. For instance, even an Accord LX has a standard back-up camera. On a BMW 320i that adds $950. Want a color aside from white or black on your 320i? Well, that's another $550.
If you get a 320i in white with one option, the back-up camera, it has a list of $34,650. You'll probably never be able to find one in stock like that, and so you'd have to special order it.
The 320i is an awesome car, but for a list of $34,270 you can get a loaded to the gills Accord Touring with a V-6. Unless you get the software update suggested by cski, a Touring is faster than a 320i.
Still, I have to admit a 320i sounds like it would be more fun to drive."

It is a better car than mine, hands down. From the steering to the throttle to the suspension, I think it is a great poor man's BMW.

m6user,Jul-14,I don't understand how the Accord can be faster than the Mazda6. The 6 has about the same horsepower and torque if not more and reaches at lower RPMs for both than the Accord. The Mazda6 even weighs a little less. Must be gearing I guess because the Mazda6 gets better MPG.

I most certainly did not mean any disrespect towards you or your post. The current generation F30 BMW 320i is certainly a nice car. I've had one as a loaner once. While it is far from a road rocket, the 320i is a solid highway cruiser and provides adequate acceleration. I do like the larger size, bigger trunk, & great cup holders. I even think the chassis is stronger & more agile than my E90 328xi. The problem is that I don't KNOW. The electric power steering provides absolutely ZERO feedback & the suspension is tuned way too soft for my liking. Try optioning up that 320i like it is an Accord Touring and any value quotient gets washed away rather quickly.
The first BMW I ever drove was a friend's 1995 E36 BMW 325is (sport pkg - manual transmission). After barely knowing how to drive a stick, I was speeding through the streets of downtown Buffalo, NY and using the throttle to rotate the car around corners by the end of the night. That one drive made me lust after BMWs for the next 12 years when I finally leased a 2007 X3 for my wife. Then in 2012 traded in my perfectly good 2010 Acura TSX Tech for my current (and soon to be departed) 2011 328xi. I don't get that from a 320i or really any of BMW's current offerings. I even have a friend with a 2013 F10 ///M5 that is mega fast, but not what I'd pay $120K for.
Many don't understand that with the BMW, you are paying for that dedicated RWD chassis that is more expensive to design & produce than Honda's ""global mid sized platform.""
I happen to LOVE my E90 328xi. I think it is a fantastic car. But I wouldn't classify it as ""awesome"" either."

Accord- vs- the Mazda6
Buying either car comes down to what your preference is. Once you decide you will be very happy with either vehicle. I'd like to hear your thoughts/ review on the accord sport vs the mazda6.
Here are my thoughts. between the 2 vehicles....@benjaminh is right on with his assessments. I test drove the mazda6. I personally think the Accord sport model and mazda6 are very close in the h/p dept. What separates the Mazda is very good handling and cornering. That's what makes this sedan feel quicker than the Accord. The Accord cvt motor is rated best in class. The Mazda suspension is very firm. On uneven roads you will bounce around especially with the 19' tires. The Accords suspension is more relaxed but again the Mazda handles and corners a lot better at faster speeds.. Both are great choices. You have to decide which ride you prefer. I found the radio to be better in the Mazda and the leather seats more comfortable in the accord. I liked the layout and features better in my Accord. The sport is not the upgrade model. The Mazda has a more sporty look and feel. The Accord has a classier look inside. I have the EXL V-6 model
A, Accord sport test drive is a must before you decide. The new Accord is a well rounded family vehicle. Find roads that are not that even or have some bumps , pot holes, small road holes to see if you like how this Mazda's suspension handles it. The ride is firm. What made me buy the Accord was the new look, a 280 h/p v-6 engine, the ride, cargo rm, big trunk, and tech features. This new Accords road noise is a lot quieter inside the cabin from past years . Mazda interior cabin noise has improved a lot from previous years. Still not acceptable to me. Edge to the Accord.
Edmunds summed up the mazda6 the best.
With its communicative, precise steering and sporty chassis tuning, the 2014 Mazda 6 feels sharp-witted and willing around corners, with stand-out dynamics for the class. The flip side, however, is that the 6 rides a bit more stiffly than competitors, especially with the 19-inch wheels. Like many Mazdas, the 6 is a car for practical-minded buyers with enthusiast leanings"
benjaminh,Jul-14,"The Mazda6 is sometimes faster than the Accord....
Just some additional information to add to the above test by Motor Trend that showed the Accord Sport to be slightly faster than the Mazda6, when both are equipped with an auto. Here's a test by C & D that shows that the Mazda6 is slightly faster than an Accord EXL.
Anyway, they are both pretty close in speed. That's obviously not a significant consideration either way. And so I take back and correct what I said about that before.
Before are very good cars!
http://www.caranddriver.com/comparisons/2014-mazda-6-grand-touring-vs-2013-honda-accord-ex-l-sedan-final-scoring-performance-data-and-complete-specs-page-4
The one place where the Accord has a clear edge is for the manual versions. For some reason some tests have shown that the Accord Sport manual can get to 60 in as soon as 6.6 seconds (C & D) while the Mazda6 manual is about a second slower than that iirc.
But since cski is getting an auto that's irrelevant."
[Deleted User],Jul-14,"Dude, I am starting to believe that every spec on my OPTIMA has been ""tweaked"". The 2014 Mazda 6 Touring I drove yesterday has even 3 more options....a sunroof, Bose stereo w/ 7"" screen,, and 19"" rims. Then ride was NOT punishing with that tire /wheels setup, and this time I got to drive the car for a full hour... by myself. I HATE salesman ride - along. The engine has MORE POWER than my car... or it is lighter. For 26k, I will pass on the Accord and go right over to Mazda. there is a brief spool up before the trans drops 2 gears and the engine kicks in. The engine is refined, yet growls like a sports car. I was sold. The interior quality is absolutely FINE. No poor quality pieces. There was a button called BSM THAT I ha NO idea what it dies, but I took the traction control off and it burned our through first and chirped in second. I would say 200 hp is the actual power. It is just too fast5...or too b eater geared for my car to catch up.. In general, the car felt better screwed together than mine. It was superb.
If the 6 is not to your liking, try the Mazda 3 hatchback. It is a damn nice car... even more impressive... except the Grand TOURING mODEL i SAW W2AS $29900."
[Deleted User],Jul-14,"It felt like 7 seconds.... and I am far from finalizing this deal. The payments have to be lower. I will not buy an extended warranty, or any other ""full boat"" insurance products."
Michaell,Jul-14,BSM is blind spot monitor .. my wife's CX-7 has it as well. Not sure why one would want to turn it off.
rbirns1,Jul-14,How would Altima and Sonata (2014) compare to Accord and Mazda6?
stickguy,Jul-14,Some people turn off the nanny monitors if the get tired of beeps and flashes. Not sure what he Mazda does. I do like the idea of BSM. Would not mind that on our Acura.
stickguy,Jul-14,"IMO, having driven both, not as nice to drive but a lot cheaper now. Good feature per $ quotient."
[Deleted User],Jul-14,"The Accord is great. I drove a Sport. It was like mine with faster steering. There was no difference in speed, better handling but poor tracking (due to the 18"" wheels?) There was no such feeling in the Mazda. The trunk is huge, the back seat is the same size as the one I have now, it has better quality seat materials, and god it is a beautiful car. I like the base model too, but I don't live in West Virginia and there is no where to enjoy a stick. Lastly, with three kids and two bags of McDonald's to pass around, then I have no hand or knees to drive it, and then once under way, I get to sit in traffic while my clutch burns up. My choice is the Mazda 6 Touring.... hands down.. Even the VW isn't as tightly screwed together as the Mazda. Amazing car."
nyccarguy,Jul-14,"@stickguy‌
The high belt lines & thick ""D"" pillars prevalent on most cars today almost necessitate back up cameras, blind spot monitoring systems, & innovations like Honda's Lane Watch.
I know my parents (in their mid to late 60's) recently had cars with Blind Spot Monitors (2010 Chevy Tahoe LTZ & 2011 Porsche Cayenne V6) and traded up to cars without the Blind Spot Monitors (2011 Chevy Tahoe LTZ & 2013 BMW X5). Almost immediately, they both said they miss the Blind Spot Monitors a lot.
I had the backup camera on my TSX and don't have it on my 328xi. I do miss it. It is a fantastic feature."
stickguy,Jul-14,I don't think we could drive the RDX without the back up camera. Terrible rear visibility.
explorerx4,Jul-14,@cski You seem to be pretty stuck on the Mazda 6. You should head over to 'Real World Trade In Values' to hopefully get an estimated value for your Optima.
backy,Jul-14,"I agree, wrt the 2014 Sonata (I haven't driven the Altima yet). The 2014 Sonata is a great bargain at the current close-out pricing. I've seen GLSes with alloys/heated seats advertised locally for around $17k or $200/month for a 36 month lease with 0 out of pocket. It's a lot of car for that money, and I think a pleasant car to live with. Not as nice as newer designs like the Accord and Mazda6, but a car that I think would be fine for 90% of the demographic who buys mid-sized family sedans."
stickguy,Jul-14,"after driving both, I think I liked the Altima better. But I would have to try them both again back to back to make sure."
ahightower,Jul-14,"@cski, sounds like you're in love. An excellent choice. I was really torn between Mz6 Touring and Accord Sport. There were a few details that made me fall for the Honda.
1) Gearbox: Now, there were no manual 6's around, so I didn't get to compare directly (my test drive was an automatic 6), but the press tend to prefer the Honda's manual, and it just felt perfect to me. You prefer automatic, and I didn't drive an Accord CVT, so cannot compare there. But we have a CVT in our Pathfinder and I actually like it a LOT. If I can't have a manual, then give me infinite gears!
2) Power: Acceleration and speed may be roughly equivalent on paper, but the way the Honda delivers in the mid range is very nice. The 6 never felt terribly lacking, but the Honda just felt as if the engine was its centerpiece.
3) Room: At 6'3"", the Honda gave a slight edge in knee room up front. Only the Optima was better at this. 6 was fine (esp. compared to my old 3), but the Accord felt more open. Its rear seat is HUGE, and I regularly put the kids three across with no complaints. 6 also has a nice rear bench, but it seemed shaped a bit more to favor the outboard, whereas the Accord's middle seat is nice and flat, and the floor hump is very low.
4) Materials: The 6 didn't feel cheap by any stretch. It's perfectly nice. But the Accord's steering wheel, center screen, and the little knurled metal finish around the knobs just made me feel as if I'd landed in an Acura. And the Accord, to my surprise, rode very quietly, except for a nice engine growl when you punch it.
I wanted to love the 6. It's beautiful and less common. And if they'd had a manual in red, I'd probably have gotten stars in my eyes and never gone back for a second look at the Accord. You really cannot go wrong. But as others have said, you must at least test the Accord to settle things in your own mind.
Also, unless the one you're seeing has some options not mentioned, $26K sounds rather high. Accords are going for several hundred below invoice. The Accord may fit your budget better (and good luck getting $17K for the Optima. I imagine they are offering closer to $12-13K?)"
benjaminh,Jul-14,"cski:
As you probably know, Mazda currently has 0% for 60 months on the 6. That should help.
Given that your Optima is c. 3 years old, it seems like it might be a stretch to get 17k in trade on it. How much did you pay for it? For the heck of it, I played with the Edmunds trade-in estimator for a 2012 Optima EX in Outstanding condition with 30k miles. It said trade-in was around $15k. What year is yours?
The Mazda should have better resale value than the KIA. But it's hard to beat the Honda on that score. In part because of higher resale and lower repair costs, I've seen figures showing that the 5 year cost of ownership is lower for the Accord than for any other midsize car.
Anyway, as someone else said, $26k for a Mazda6 Touring does seem potentially steep, depending on the options. What's the msrp for it?"
benjaminh,Jul-14,"This is an advantage that the Accord has over some competitors.
There's a rave review of the Mazda6 in Truth About Cars that mentions the sloping rear roofline:
""....It’s true that ingress and egress to the rear passenger compartment is complicated by the sloping roofline but the situation is easily remedied by opening your eyes and not smashing your head into the door frame. If you find the process too daunting, you are probably lucky Darwin hasn’t yet come to claim you as an evolutionary failure....""
http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2014/07/reader-review-2014-mazda6/#more-863065
Probably that doesn't matter very much to you, cski. But just in case I thought I'd mention it.
But I did something rather like you did with your Optima when I got a Mazda5 in 2010—I didn't test it thoroughly enough to see what the kinks were in design. But like your Optima, the Mazda5 has big blind spots in the rear. I found I didn't like that at all, but by that time I already owned it, which I did for a few years before eventually deciding to trade it in on an Accord.
The rear visibility is probably better in the Mazda6 than in the Optima, but not by a lot because of that sloping rear roof, high beltline, and thick rear pillar. When you were in the Accord did you notice the excellent visibility?"
ab348,Jul-14,"Well TTAC is pretty non-credible with a lot of their opinions (in MY opinion!) but this is an owner review so there could be some self-justification going on there. I was struck by his comments about some of the things it does not come with (auto up/down windows, etc) and some noise issues. I would be very casreful to spend a lot of time with the car before signing the deal to make sure I would be OK with all those things. Coming out of an Optima, which as I recall has a lot of bells and whistles, the 6 might seem a bit de-contented."
stevedebi,Jul-14,"My wife has the backup camera on her Passat, but my 2008 FEH has the backup sensors. I find the sensors pretty easy to use, but I think I prefer the camera.
The advantage to the sensors is I can concentrate on the parking overall while still knowing about how far out the car to the rear is. With the camera one has to keep the concentration on the screen."
brian125,Jul-14,"cski,
Just to add to above posts.. If you could get 15 to 16 k for a 2 going on 3 yr optima. Take the money and run. Resale is not good on this vehicle..
Pricing on a Accord sport in your area will be from 1700 to 2200 below invoice price before paying dealers doc fee charge. MD and VA have some of the best pricing in the country on Accords, Civic's, and Pilots right now.. If you decide on the Accord let me know we will work on getting that 2k below number.
Another good point is the back seat issue. w/ 3 kids and the contoured 6's, seat might be tight .
@ab348.. had a good point about coming out of your Optima and its features. Take your time and thoroughly investigate what exactly your family needs and don't need.. Especially if this vehicle will be a every day hauler...
Below is the Accord sport invoice price w/ dest charge of 790. Your target price to buy is 2k below dealers invoice.
23,225 minus 2k=.................. 21,225 On this price you need to add dealers doc fee charge, plus taxes and tags for your OTD price.
For about 22,950 with taxes and tags included you could walk out with this model. I calculated this on 6% sales tax.
Your Mazda 6 is a supply and demand vehicle unless dealer needs sales numbers or is looking to move off there lot your price wont be as good as the Accord . Let me take a look at Mazda's hold- back numbers, and Incentives I will IM you with a target price to buy.
I guess those coil overs are a after thought...lol"
benjaminh,Jul-14,"Brian has some good points. Do you really think it's possible to get an Accord Sport for 2k less than invoice?! If so, that's an incredible deal. Sounds like almost $4k less than the Mazda6. The 6 will have better stereo and some other stuff, plus superior handling, etc., but...."
brian125,Jul-14,"Yes with certainty especially with dealers like Criswell, Pohanka, Chantilly , and Hendrick Honda just to name a few in his area. There have been many Edmunds buyers that I sent to these dealerships that did very well at months end April, may, June . If cski could pull the trigger end of July.. he wont be disappointed."
Michaell,Jul-14,"But, you may end up driving a car you don't like, simply because of the deal.
I did that years ago when I was shopping for a mid-size sedan. I wanted V6 and leather. I looked at the Camry, Passat and Accord. Passat was over $30K and the Camry was a bit of a snooze fest. The Accord has just been released, and I was not sure how I felt about its looks.
So I ended up with ....
A Saturn L300. 0% financing and a GM supplier discount made it much cheaper than anything else I had looked at. Had aftermarket leather added."
m6user,Jul-14,Why are Accords being sold for $2000 below invoice in a record setting year(so far) for auto sales???
robr2,Jul-14,"Because the 2015 Accord is expected to be come out ""mid 2014"" so they need to clear out the 2014 models."

[Deleted User],Jul-14,"I get it now. And thanks so much for the nice explanation. So, I took may car in for its 30k service, and had some errands to do. The service manager immediately brought me out a black 2014 Turbo, and I have to tell you they have made some very good improvements to the cars solid feel, steering, and powertrain conjugation. They wanted to give me 17k for mine, and offered 27k, for the turbo with the dual sun roof, and a couple neat features. I enjoyed the Infinity stereo, although the only difference is the 8"" subwoofer installed in the rear deck, and better tweeters.
Well, I already have a Kicker 600.1 sub amp, dual 10"" subs, Alpine door speakers, a second Kicker 200.4 4 channel amp, (50 watts RMS per channel) so, it came down to the fact that I have too much love money, and work put into my car to just give it away and start over on another car. Lastly, the car was just not that fast. In most situations it would not be right for the congestion in this area. Bummer."
nyccarguy,Jul-14,"@cski‌
Unfortunately that is the realization of the congested areas we live in. I thought the traffic here in NY was bad until I visited our nation's capital last summer. Let me tell you something, we are amateurs when it comes to traffic compared to you guys.
Part of the reason I'm not looking into getting another BMW when my lease is up in September (besides the fact that I'm going to try and NOT spend as much this time around) is the same thing. Do I really need ""The Ultimate Driving Machine"" to commute back and forth to work 6 days a week where the speed limit is 55 and then 50 once I get into the NYC Limits? How fast can I reasonably drive? Most days I set my cruise at 70 in the AM, maybe 75 if the traffic allows. At night I take a road all the way home with a 50 mph speed limit. The cops give tickets if I go over 65."
brian125,Jul-14,"Not all area's are selling Accords for 2k below . MA, MD, VA, CA, are tops with pricing. In CT,NY, NJ, DE, PA, NC, SC, GA, FL deals are ranging from 900 to 1500 below dealers invoice after paying dealers doc fee charge. Most educated buyers are in that 1200 to 1500 below range right now.. Buyers that are better negotiators are getting the higher end of these prices. 2015' Accords will be out late Sept.
The 2014 Mazda' 6's are limited on dealers lots. with the higher end 2014 models left. Sticker price on the Touring models are 32k plus...... The 2015's are on lots already."
Kirstie_H,Jul-14,"The fact that both of these options are becoming available on more and more vehicles is a bit distressing to me. Pretty soon, everyone's going to feel competent enough to parallel park, increasing the competition for the primo spaces in our downtown (which largely go unused, thanks to fear and inexperience)."
brian125,Jul-14,"@Kirstie_H
We might need another Enron/ wall street/ GM bail out. These rear view camera's are in some small vehicles now. Maybe it will help folks not hit the car behind them.

brian125,Jul-14,"rbirns1
Your models invoice is 21,342. There is a 2000 dollar rebate from Hyundai and a 500 loyalty rebate totaling 2500 off the above price. That alone is 18,842. Excluding taxes and tags. If I'm buying this model in NY my target price is 17k. True car pricing is very good on Hyundai's. Go to the web site and put in your info from NY. . Then google Fritz automall Hyundai, in MD. Use there zip code as if you were buying vehicle in that area. This will give you a head start on pricing. Use these prices as a guide but not a final price. The Popular equip. pck #2 = 819 dollars.
Use Nada.com its alot easier to find pricing and packages. Edmunds pricing web page is confusing to most to navigate thru there pages.

Both is better..."
akirby,Jul-14,I have both and it's great. But the best feature by far is cross traffic alert when backing out of a parking space. I can be in between 2 big trucks and back out with confidence even when you can't see left or right (2013 Fusion).

ahightower,Jul-14,"Agreed. Our Pathfinder has both camera and beeping, which is great. Although I'm not crazy about the look of the sensors in the bumper, and imagine it would add to the cost of body work. If I could only have one, it'd be the camera."

2013 Honda Accord Sport Verdict
By Ron Kiino | Photos By Motor Trend Staff | From the September 2014 issue of Motor Trend
....Armed with the so-called Earth Dreams direct-injected engine, which touts 4 more horsepower and 1 extra lb-ft (up to 182) compared to non-Sport I-4 Accords, our long-termer zipped from 0 to 60 mph in 7.5 seconds and through the quarter mile in 15.8 at 90.8 mph. As I mentioned in a prior update, that 0-60 stat makes the Sport a tenth quicker than a 1998 Lexus GS300. Even better, it's 0.2 second quicker than our long-term 182-hp 2013 Nissan Altima SL and only 0.3 slower than our turbocharged 274-hp 2013 Kia Optima SXL. Better still, the Accord, EPA rated at 26/35/29 mpg city/highway/combined, returned observed fuel economy of 28.6 mpg, a healthy 1.4 mpg better than the 27.2 of the 27/38/31-rated Altima, and, in case you're wondering, markedly superior to the 22.8 of the 22/34/26-rated Optima.
More than quick at the dragstrip and frugal at the gas pump, the Accord proved plenty able at the handling track. In our figure-eight test, the Sport, wearing 235/45R18 Michelin Primacy MXM4 all-season tires, clocked a time of 26.7 seconds and maximum lateral acceleration of 0.88 g. By comparison, the sporty 205-horsepower Honda Civic Si in this issue could only muster 26.9 seconds and 0.86 g, and that was with summer tires....
Over its nearly 23,000 miles of service, the Accord Sport remained a reliable transporter, requiring not one unscheduled dealer visit....

ahightower,Jul-14,...And that was with the CVT.
benjaminh,Jul-14,"Yes. With the manual it's almost a second faster to 60.
Here's an interesting comparison. Which would you choose: A Civic Si sedan ($22,990) or an Accord Sport 6MT ($23,715).
For $725 the Accord seems like a lot more car. Smaller is better sometimes esp. for tight traffic conditions, but ironically the Accord gets better mpg (28 combined compared to 25) because of the Earth Dreams engine which the Civic lacks. The Civic Si does have a better stereo, as well as a limited slip differential, but otherwise their level of equipment is similar iirc.
I'd go with the Accord Si. Although I've been on vacation and just gotten a chance to drive my brother-in-laws 2012 Civic Si and it's a blast. It really is a tough call."

We're 44 days out from Disney World, and I'm actually looking forward to that drive in a strange way, as it will be the first real test of our new Pathfinder.

NOT a complaint about the hours saved and infrequency of filling up... but watching the lifetime avg go down on fuelly is no fun. I'm in the mood to take a nice long country road day trip, just for lunch or something."

[Deleted User],Jul-14,"Hey guys. I have been busy. I couldn't hold out as a mature 43 year old and I bought a floor jack and painted my brake calipers. Since my car is red, they look normal and very much stock that way. After that my Lamina-X Headlight covers/Protectors came in, which match my fog light covers.
I have to stop screwing with it now. I am starting to feel like a hoarder... and OCD for sure.
Sooooo........
Then I went on an eBay rampage. I bought the Kicker dual 10"" subs and the kicker 300.1 amp to run it. Then I bought a Kicker 200.4 amp (50 watts X4). So, of course the stick speakers had to got to feel like one of those collectors (they are crap). I replaced the stockers with 4 Alpine ""E"" series speakers, and a set of 2 Kicker 6.5"" door speakers for the rear deck. Yep....I am gong to use the rear deck for speakers, just as s god intended. The Kicker amplifiers and Alpine amps and speakers are highly respected by the car stereo install people I have spoken to and from the research I have undertaken. Each Kicker amplifier comes with its own detailed certificate on how much power it actually puts out RMS. They are all underrated. My 600.1 sub amp actually puts out 327 watts RMS and the 200.4 amp is certified at 231 RMS, so 57 watts per channel.
So, I had it all installed by the Geek Squad at Best Buy. They did a great job, except that they did not hook up the fader correctly. I have to move the fader more to the back for LESS rear output. Totally backward. Going over to get it fixed at 10:30,
Back to mid size-
I drove a 14 Mazda 6 Touring and it felt almost as fast as the Optima turbo. The SX Turbo version of m y car felt much improved in steering, Handling is vastly better than mine, it's steering was much faster and quick to move of enter. The I/P has been upgraded. The center stack LCD display on my SX had a tiny center stack display. Embarrassingly tiny. The I/P is nice... the center stack looks cheap with the base stereo, and it looked mismatched somewhat. I guess it looked weird because I have had my6 car for years and it looks like everything matches.
I strongly feel Mazda needs t do just a minor center stack upgrade and it would,d draw in mnire customers, I found the LCD's to be tiny (like digital watch tiny), So the dual zone A/C LCD displays are hard to read. I liked the enter stack display, but would have to poll out the manual on a few things. The sunroof was nice.
The Bose stereo was excellent, and had a lot of bass. The seats looked nice and there was a sight whiff of loath when I got in the car. The steering is fantastic, the handling was fantastic, the engine was adequate, and the transmission helped me slow down by down shifting on its own like when stopping for a light from 60 mph.
Had the 6 and the Accord been available at the end of 2011....like December 23rd 2011, I might be driving a Mazda 6 Touring right now.
I honestly think Mazda's horsepower may be conservatively rated. It is notably faster than my car, and when it downshifts to pass at say 65....it just flies. I was very glad to have the opportunity to drive it for over an hour without a chaperone, but felt kind of bad for the nice young man assigned to me as salesperson. I would have bought a car from him in a. minute. For people shopping for a mid size, Fairfax Kia and Brown's Fairfax Mazda are right across the street from each other. Also less than a mile away are three other car dealerships. Chevy, Volvo, Fairfax Honda, and Ford/Lincoln"

I would just get the EX with optional open/close air intake covers, real transmission,, far less complicated, and in the real world you may save 1 mpg. Read soe reviews n it first,"
benjaminh,Jul-14,"Reviews and actual owner experiences at driveaccord.net seem to indicate that getting close to the rated mpg is possible.
You're right that it's an almost revolutionary hybrid system. I'm glad Honda is taking the lead and not just copying Toyota! The Honda Hybrid easily beats the Camry Hybrid for mpg, as well as all the other midsize hybrids on the road. Having had excellent experiences with three Accords now (2002, 2008, and 2013), I mostly trust Honda's engineering prowess—but I would probably get the extended warranty for the reasons you mention.
At this point in life, at the age of 50, I do like my cars loaded. But comparing the top-of-the-line Accord Hybrid Touring with the V-6 Accord Touring is potentially compelling.
Accord Hybrid Touring: EPA rated 47 mpg, msrp $34,905
Accord V-6 Touring: EPA rated 26 mpg, msrp $33,480
The difference in msrp is just $1425. Since the savings in gas is estimated to be as much as $900 a year, in less than two years you've covered the difference.
Or at least so it would seem. But right now the Accord Hybrid is in such demand that it's usually commanding full msrp, while the Touring can be had for as much as a $3000 discount. Since there's really a c. $4000 difference in price, it looks like about five years to really make up the difference.
But I'm hoping that by the time I'm in the market, in 2-3 years, that Honda will have upped production so that prices will have moderated.
The Accord Hybrid is one of Honda's halo cars. I actually wouldn't be surprised to learn that they are losing a little bit of money on each one they sell, which might mean that they will continue to keep production numbers rather low. But they have shown that they can leapfrog mighty Toyota on one of their signature products, which is pretty impressive."
benjaminh,Jul-14,"Consumer Reports raves about the Buick Regal:

""....If you still think of Buick as a brand only for octogenarians with a taste for whitewall tires and vinyl roof treatments, the Regal will change your mind in one test drive. It’s a thoroughly developed and satisfying midsized sports sedan that’s more reminiscent of an Audi A4 than a softly sprung luxo-barge. That European feel is no coincidence, because the Regal is based on a German design from General Motors’ Opel division....""
The Regal is actually the same size as the Optima, Accord, etc., and so counts as a midsize car."
ab348,Jul-14,I have had a 2011 model for a while and really like it. I do not think it is the same size as those you mention though. It feels and drives smaller.
benjaminh,Jul-14,"The new Regal is maybe a bit bigger than the 2011 you had. It's pretty much the same size as the Accord now. Actually the Audi A4 has grown too, but is still smaller than those two cars.
Accord length 191 inches
Regal length 190 inches
Audi A4: 185 inches
I like the interior design of the Regal from pictures. It seems like a nice combination of futuristic, European, and American luxury:
http://www.buick.com/2014-regal-luxury-sport-sedan.html
One thing about the Regal, however, is that its turbo 2.0 liter engine gets lower gas mileage than the Accord's big V-6.
Makes me really wonder if turbo is the way to go. Ford is seemingly going all in with turbo, but the mpg gains just don't really seem to be as significant as we would hope...."
dudleyr,Jul-14,"Regal is much closer in interior size to a Civic than to an Accord. Civic 95 ft3 Regal 98, Accord is 103. Trunk size is 12 ft3 for Civic and Regal 16 for Accord."
benjaminh,Jul-14,"The Regal, as you say, has less interior room and less trunk space than the Accord, but in terms of its length, width, and weight, it is very similar to the Accord. In fact, it's heavier than the Accord V-6.

I guess it comes down to styling, soundproofing, more padding on seats, etc.

I am with you 100 percent, benjaminh. I don't really care as much about how long or wide the car is, but I use the EPA's guidelines when looking for a car. The EPA uses 110 cu ft interior volume (which includes the trunk) as the breaking point between compact and midsize. We are car shopping and may look at the TLX, but we realize it is a compact sedan (106.5 cu ft). When acura says they combined the TSX and TL to make the TLX I do not see it that way. I see it as they got rid of the TL (a midsize sedan - one of two acura midsize sedans) and shrunk the TSX (already a compact) to produce the TLX - a compact. This leaves acura with the TLX as a compact and the RL (starting at $48,500) as their sole midsize sedan. (In fact, the RL is just a little smaller than the accord inside while the TLX is slightly larger than a civic, but smaller than a corolla - by EPA standards.) We also considered the Q50, but it is also a compact.... with run-flat tires and a spare - go figure! (Reading blogs on the Q50 also steered us away.) We are now waiting for the 2015 maxima. We considered a 2014 maxima, but the crash test (according to Edmunds) of a 2 star for the passenger and poor protection in a rear end collision negated that (but the 2014 is quite a buy at this time). Once the 2015 maxima is out - with crash test results - we'll give it a look. But it's stuff like I mentioned above (size - compacts; or safety with the maxima) that will lead me back to looking at a camry if I am not happy. I am in no hurry to buy, but am only going to buy what fits our wants/needs.
BTW - cski - your car looks sharp!"
benjaminh,Jul-14,wayne21: Would you consider an Accord Touring?
wayne21,Jul-14,"In spite of looking at an acura, I do so reluctantly. We take excellent care of everything we own and we had an accord that had the original plus 3 rebuilt transmissions in less than 90k miles. It's the only car we've ever had with a transmission replaced. In spite of knowing the acura is a Honda product, I would consider it. But no, I am not interested in an accord. In fact, my wife has made it very clear that we will not be looking at an accord. Car purchases require a ""two vote"" and I don't think she's interested in discussing it."
benjaminh,Jul-14,"Understandable.
I had bad car experiences with Ford and VW. I'm still not ready to forgive, even though that was many years ago. And, in contrast, I've always had good experiences with Honda reliability and quality, plus when things do need work Honda has taken care of me so far.
Car makers must know that a bad experience can turn a customer off of that brand forever...."
wayne21,Jul-14,"One only buys so many cars in a lifetime and for me, if I get burned once I tend to stay away. Our daughter-in-law has a 2010 accord. I know she's had issues, but I asked our son about their Honda experience. He says the Honda has been to the shop more than their dogs have been to the vet. That pretty much drove a nail in the Honda coffin for my wife.... and probably me. But still willing to look at a TLX."
ahightower,Jul-14,"Nissan was off my list for years because a couple of relatively minor but very poorly handled issues with a 2004 Quest. I've had Altimas as rentals a few times since then, and liked them well enough. Always stay up on new car reviews and Nissan seems to have gained equal footing with Honda and Toyota (and/or, those two have lost some of the luster and lack of criticism they used to get from name alone). Decided to give the brand another try, and ended up really liking our Pathfinder. But still, I only gave them a chance because I knew we'd be leasing, therefore always under warranty... and the dealer is very close to my office, just in case I have to use that warranty a lot...
Heck, I'll avoid certain brands of electronics, clothes, even restaurants and groceries, if I detect an inferior product. Now take 1,000X the money, plus a lousy customer service experience to go along with the poor product.
It's easy to tell someone, ""Oh, that was five/ten/twenty years ago, you should give them another chance..."" But when there is a competitor keeping me happy, it's hard to give a second chance to the one who burned me. It's not even a matter of money alone, the inconvenience of free warranty repairs is a drag. Especially as one's life becomes more complicated by work and family obligations. I've far less time to waste on dealer service issues than I did in my 20's. You get to a point where truly, time is money, and you'll gladly pay more for peace of mind and perceived quality.
So, yeah. I agree. Not nice to hold a grudge, but it's a big job for an automaker to maintain and repair its reputation."
suydam,Jul-14,"Especially if you have a choice of automakers you have had good experience with. Between Honda, Toyota, Mazda and Nissan I can usually find something that works well for me."
m6user,Jul-14,"The Buick Regal is a midsize car. It is marketed as a midsize and the buying public considers it a midsize. The Buick Verano is the compact offering. Whoever said the TLX is smaller than the TSX is just plain misinformed and should check the facts. The TLX is bigger than the TSX and a little smaller than the TL. In fact, the wheelbase on the new TLX and the TL are basically the same. It fits clearly into the midsize realm. However, it is is not a ""midsize sedan"" as discussed here as it is considered a luxury brand. Some like to call it a ""near luxury"" bran because it isn't quite as luxurious as say a Lexus, but it is certainly the premium brand for Honda motor company just the the Lexus and Infiniti are for the Toyota and Nissan respectively.
I have never once referred to the EPA classification when shopping for a car as overall interior volume means little to me. In most cases it is just a little more headroom that, unless you're very tall, don't use in the first place. The Honda Accord has a high roof line in comparison to most of the other midsize car styles out there now. So what happens? Bigger interior volume. But if you compare most of the actual measurements such as shoulder room, leg room, and hip room the numbers are almost identical. I laugh sometimes at the volume they list for behind the second or third rows on SUVs/CUVs. The volume may be there but it is mostly unusable vertical space with little floor room to be very useful."
dudleyr,Jul-14,Last I checked headroom was an actual measurement and it is one of the things that keeps cars like the Regal from appealing to people who use the back seat - no headroom.
m6user,Jul-14,"I didn't say headroom was not measured. Get real. Check the headroom numbers and please tell me which one has ""no headroom""."
rbirns1,Jul-14,"TL, TLX, TSX...so damn confusing. Why can't they bring back Legend and Integra?
Lincoln is even worse. All those MK's, I have no idea which is which."
benjaminh,Jul-14,"Here's an off-the-wall car that could potentially be considered by people looking at midsize: the all-new VW Golf GTI 4-door.
Everyone would likely say it's a different class of car. Fair enough. But in terms of interior room it's pretty darn close. Take a look at a few comparisons.
Accord rear headroom: 37.8, rear legroom: 38.5, cargo: 15.8
Mazda6 rear headroom: 37.1, rear legroom: 38.7, cargo: 14.8
Golf GTI rear headroom: 38.1, rear legroom: 35.6, cargo: 22.8
And look at the overall lengths of these cars. Accord: 191.4, Mazda6: 191.5, Golf: 168. Talk about packaging efficiency. Wow.
Hard to believe that huge cargo figure for the Golf, but if you stuff it to the roof I guess so. But that means for 2 out of 3 of these particular measurements the Golf beats the Accord and the 6!
It will also easily beat them going 0-60. It would also beat the times of all other midsize cars with turbos, I think, and maybe even the Accord V-6.
The list price of the Golf GTI 4-door starts at $25k.
The mpg of the new GTI is better than the past version, but still can't match the class leaders in midsize. Accord epa combined mpg: 30, Mazda6: 30, Golf GTI: 28.
When the regular Golf comes out, which is very soon, I think, it will have a 1.8 turbo rather than a 2.0 turbo. The regular Golf will probably equal the Accord and the 6 in mpg. And the diesel Golf will probably get a rating of c. 35 mpg combined."
wayne21,Jul-14,I use the EPA size rating when car shopping. I don't really care what a car company markets something as since they do it for their own benefit. The EPA is a standard measurement no matter who makes the car. The EPA classifies the Buick Regal as a midsize sedan.
m6user,Jul-14,Where do you think the EPA gets its numbers from?
m6user,Jul-14,"The GTI is hatchback, not a sedan. I haven't checked but I would bet there are many cars that have similar or comparable interior dimensions as the midsizers we discuss here."
backy,Jul-14,"The sedan version, the Jetta, has amazing interior room (especially back seat leg room) and trunk volume for a compact car. I suggested a few days ago to someone looking for a mid-sized car with a stick that it might be a good alternative. Personally though I'd go for the Golf, with hatchback versatility and soon an all-new design, with much higher interior quality than the Jetta's--almost Audi-esque based on what I saw at my local auto show earlier this year. The only drawback I see for the Golf other than it will now be sourced from Mexico for the USA market, instead of Germany, is that the base trim MT is a 5-speed. However, I found the 5-speed on the current Golf to be ok, with a tall 5th gear that keeps RPMs low. Also the price on the Golf is pretty high. Could probably get a base model mid-sized sedan for the same price as a base-model Golf."
ab348,Jul-14,I fit in the back seat of my Regal quite comfortably and I am 6' with a long torso.
benjaminh,Jul-14,"I agree with backy that the all-new Golf is a strangely compelling car. It's ""strange"" for me, because I was burned by a used 1987 Jetta that I owned from 1997-2000. That was eons ago in car years, but the shoddy engineering of that car seriously annoyed me. The hood release, for instance, kept breaking because of an uber-cheap plastic part that was essential to its operation.
But some things about that Jetta were great. The trunk was astonishingly large for a car that size. Iirc it was 16.5 cubic feet—which is a little larger than the trunk of my 2013 Accord! The handling of that Jetta was German road-car worthy. It was really fun to drive when it worked.
But, like many other people, my seemingly endless trips to the VW service bay made me feel like I was making a lot of payments on someone else's boat. I remember parts that took weeks to ship from Germany, etc.
I assume those bad old days are behind VW now, and that their cars are well-built and reliable. Still, there's a reason millions of people like me are wary of buying a VW.
But as backy says, what's appealing about the new Golf in particular is the idea of getting an almost Audi-level of car for many thousands of dollars less. And part of that is because it's made in Mexico. Here's an interesting article on the huge factory in Mexico that makes VWs. It's the biggest VW factory outside of Germany, and employs a massive 20,000 people. It just celebrated its 50th anniversary:
http://www.roadandtrack.com/features/web-originals/volkswagen-mexico-factory-things-we-learned
I guess I'm glad Mexico's auto industry is booming. But I'm also glad my Accord is made in Ohio. It's a small but significant thing for me to know that my hard-earned money is circulating in the US and helping the economy here....
Anyway, Motor Week has a rave review of the 2015 GTI. And they say that the new base Golf will have a starting msrp of c. $19k—which is $2-4k less than most entry-level midsize sedans."
wayne21,Jul-14,"The EPA has set the standards for years. It gets the interior room data from the manufacturers. Thus the Regal is a midsize sedan and the TSX and new TLX are compact sedans. If you don't think so, check the interior room for them and you'll see they are in fact both compact sedans. The new (compact) TLX is actually smaller than the (compact) TSX."
dudleyr,Jul-14,"You said the other measurements were ""actual"" hence headroom was not.
I did check and I have sat in one. No headroom."
wayne21,Jul-14,"To clarify my point. The EPA has set the standards for car classification via interior volume for many years. It is the industry standard. The manufacturers use their interior volume to the EPA for classification. If you go to the EPA website it will tell you the size classification for a car (you can also check Edmunds for the interior volume). IF you disagree with the classification you can either contact the manufacturer and ask for a remeasurement (good luck) or contact the EPA and tell them they've got it wrong and tell them what the standards should be to meet ""your"" classification (again, good luck). (I hope it doesn't wrap these numbers when I post.)
EPA car class
Total passenger and cargo volume (cu. ft.)
Minicompact Less than 85 cu ft
Subcompact 85–99 cu ft
Compact 100–109 cu ft
Mid-size 110–119 cu ft
Large 120 cu ft or more
Infiniti Q50: interior volume (cu ft): 101.9 (compact)
2014 TSX: EPA Total Interior Volume = 108.5 cu ft (compact)
Acura TLX: EPA Total Interior Volume = 106.5/107.6 cu ft (compact)
(of note - the compact TLX is smaller than the compact TSX)
2014 TL: EPA Total Interior Volume = 111.3 cu ft (midsize)
2014 ACURA RLX: EPA Total Interior Volume = 117 cu ft (midsize)
2014 ACCORD: EPA Total Interior Volume = 119 cu ft (midsize)
2014 CAMRY: EPA INTERIOR VOLUME = 118.1 cu.ft. (midsize)
2014 CIVIC: EPA Total Interior Volume = 107.4 cu.ft. (compact)
2014 COROLLA: EPA INTERIOR VOLUME = 110.5 cu.ft. (midsize)*
*The corolla is typically thought of as a compact. IDK if they advertise it as a compact or as a midsize"
benjaminh,Jul-14,"wayne21: thanks. Great info!++
2015 VW Golf GTI passenger volume=93.5+luggage 22.8=
total interior volume 116.3
In other words, it seems like the GTI is a midsize car by the EPA's measure, just a short one.
Since it weighs 3031 lbs, it's only a couple of hundred pounds less than an Accord Sport 6MT, which weighs 3276."
ab348,Jul-14,"And since we are talking about the Regal:
rear headroom 36.8 rear legroom 37.3 cargo 14.2
So it's a bit tighter than the Accord or the 6. Still, the rear compartment is perfectly fine for most normal-sized people."
m6user,Jul-14,"@wayne21‌
I wasn't arguing that Regal should not be classified as a midsize because I agree that it is...but not because it fits into an EPA category. Buick markets it that way and their compact offering is the Verano. Manufacturers, as a rule, don't market two cars that are very different in size as being in the same category. Like Toyota has the Yaris(subcompact), Corolla(compact), Camry(midsize), and Avalon(large). The EPA is just a govt agency that has a somewhat arbitrary definition of what midsize, large, compact size cars are. It sets no ""industry standard"" for the auto industry. The manufacturers have not signed up for these definitions like you say they have just because they have to furnish data to the govt. I'm pretty sure VW markets the GTI as a compact and the Passat as a midsize car. I don't think Acura is going to market the TLX as a compact car as they market the ILX as a compact car. What if the Accord had just one more cubic ft of space. Would everyone suddenly think it was a large car just because it would fall into the EPA large car definition? I don't think so. It would still be a midsize and be compared to other midsize cars and not to a Taurus or 300. The Corolla is a midsize?? Pretty sure Toyota markets it as a compact and the Camry as their midsize car. That's what I mean about the EPA methodology.....it just doesn't jive with the real world. Nobody in their right mind thinks the Corolla is a midsize car.
I don't think many people go the EPA website looking to see what ""class"" the EPA thinks the car they are looking at is classified as. Outside dimensions mean as much to people as inside dimensions as that affects how easy the car is to drive, park and store. Could it be handy to see their numbers. Sure I guess so, but like I said, I've never went to their site for that reason and I don't think many people do. I believe the vast majority go there to compare MPG numbers it they go to it at all.
You seem to think that just because the EPA says something that we should all accept that they are the final say on car classes. They are not. It's fine that you think the classifications they come up with work for you but I don't think that very many people would consider a GTI or a Corolla a midsize car no matter how much room it has inside and behind the second row or because the EPA might have it in a certain category.
I'm not arguing with you, just saying that the EPA is not the end all - be all in car classifications. I personally go to cars.com and compare cars using their compare tool. It lists the passenger volume and the trunk/cargo volume on separate lines. But I don't add them up to see what class they are in according to the EPA."
m6user,Jul-14,"Oh, just for grins I went to the Mazda website to see how they market the Mazda2. They call it ""IT’S SUBCOMPACT. NOT SUB-PERFORMANCE"". Guess what, the EPA classifies it as a Compact Car. So much for the EPA being the industry standard. There are other examples of this too as this discussion has come up before in this forum."
benjaminh,Jul-14,"It's impressive, isn't it, how various trims and option levels can transform what is basically the same car. I was recently in Seattle visiting my mom, who owns a 2013 Accord LX CVT. We own a 2013 Accord EXL Navi. The engine, transmission, body, and so much else are identical, and yet the experience of driving the car was different in a few important ways imho.
The LX is a great deal on a lot of car for a street price of about $21k. And at first it's hard to see how the same basic car would still be a good deal with essentially $7000 in various options to move all the way up four trim levels to the EXL navi. But they are both worth it.
The first thing you notice is the steering wheel. The LX steering wheel is solid and economical plastic, grippy and functional. But it certainly doesn't give any ""premium"" feel at all. I've seen reviews in car mags comment on this, and I was surprised to find myself agreeing that a nicely leather wrapped wheel really is a very nice tactile thing that subtly enhances the driving experience.
Next are the seats. The cloth seats in the LX Accord are quite nice and comfortable, but the leather seats seemed more comfortable and nicer.
I never got a chance to drive the LX in a spirited way, but I imagine there are differences there because of the suspension upgrade (shock tower bar) and wheel and tire upgrade.
Anyway, my Mom's Accord feel like a very nice midsize economy car, while our EXL feel almost like a luxury car."
brian125,Jul-14,"Ben,
I agree with you.
If your on a budget the Accord lx model is a great choice. The cvt model shifts nice and its very peppy. I also had the V6, EXL model and I have driven the Lx model too.
Speaking of the Mazda2. I was in a dealership a few days ago and the sales guy was telling me Toyota is making there own version of the mazda2. I'm assuming There is a big market for these little cars.
Last week I meet up with some friends to play golf at Pebble Beach in CA. for a couple of days. Spent a up- seen amount of cash there so I figured I'd save some money renting a small rental car to drive down the coast to Calabasas for the rest of the week. 2013 Ford Focus. This little car had the worst visibility I have ever been in . I would of never though this. Sloped side windows, small back window. visibility was terrible all around. . Backing into spots was bad . A rear view camera would of helped. This was a dangerous car to be driven in CA. Drivers on the west coast drive a lot faster on Highways cutting in and out of lanes. My 100 h/p engine was no match to even attempt to change lanes quickly. LOL . I would never put a young driver in a vehicle like this to drive . The Corolla might of been a better choice."
robr2,Jul-14,It's a little more than that. Mazda will be building the new Toyota sub compact in their new Mexican plant. Toyota will be taking the new Mazda 2 platform and Toyota is building around it. Toyota realized the Yaris was horrible and the Mazda 2 is a pretty good driving car.
benjaminh,Jul-14,"I agree completely. This is a serious issue. On the outside, a lot of vehicles look like they would probably have pretty good visibility. But it's just ""perceived visibility"" rather than actual visibility, because those little rear window that most sedans have these days are useless from the driver's seat. You can't see out of them.
The design BMW pioneered, with the Hofmeister kink (named after Wilhelm Hofmeister, BMW's design chief from 1955-1970), is really much more functional in terms of visibility. Too bad only a few today use it, like BMW, Mercedes, Honda, and Toyota."
barnieboy,Jul-14,I think everyone has made a good point.
ab348,Jul-14,You forgot the Buick Regal.
backy,Jul-14,"Actually Mercedes does NOT use the Hofmeister Kink--maybe they don't want to appear to be mimicking BMW. Honda (Accord, Civic) uses it, but Toyota not so much (latest Avalon does). Some other automakers that use this feature pretty often are Buick (Regal, Verano, LaCrosse), Chevy (Impala, Cruze), Chrysler (200, Dart), Mazda (3, 6), Nissan (Versa, Sentra, Altima, Maxima), Subaru (Impreza, Legacy), and VW (Jetta, Passat). Hyundai used to use the Kink on cars like the Elantra and Sonata, but went away with it with its ""fluidic sculpture"" theme. But the new Genesis has one."
Mr_Shiftright,Jul-14,"Didn't Hofmeister Kink play for Germany in the World Cup?
The term reminds me of Dr. Kamm!"
backy,Jul-14,"Something that might have gotten overlooked in the debut of the 2015 Sonata is the availability this fall of an Eco model with a 1.6T engine and a new 7-speed DCT. I've read a few reviews and the consensus seems to be that the Eco model is the sportiest of the bunch, due to the relatively punchy turbo (177 HP), low weight, and the 7 speed tranny. That car is supposed to get 32 mpg (EPA combined), which is really good for a car with a full-sized interior per the EPA scale. No pricing on it yet, so I have to to wonder what kind of premium it'll command over the base model.
The other thing that I took from the reviews is that the new Sonata is a lot quieter, more solid feeling, and better planted than the old model. It appears what Hyundai did is focus on the little things on the redesign rather than go for a totally different look. Thus the new center console looks more boring than on the old car, but it was designed for ergonomics vs. flash.
It will be fun to see the comparos on the new Sonata and Legacy vs. The Rest, and see if one of those can topple the likes of the Mazda6 and Accord from 1st place."
benjaminh,Jul-14,"I agree with backy that 32 mpg for a ""full size"" car is pretty impressive.
In fact, even ten years ago that would almost seem like science fiction. Just looked it up, and a 2004 Buick LeSabre had a combined epa MPG 21.
If my math is right that's about a 50% increase in mpg right there.
Yes, the LeSabre was a little bigger inside, but still that's a lot of progress in a decade.
The EPA estimates that the difference in mpg between 21 and 32 will probably save you as much as $850 a year. I usually keep my cars about 8 years, and so for me that would be almost 7 grand.
My one worry is about whether Hyundai has done any real world testing of the mpg on this little turbo. As we know, Ford has had to reduce the numbers of some of its ecoboost cars by a few mpg. Hope that doesn't have to happen here.
It does seem like the jury is still out about whether small turbos really save you money in the long run. You get a smaller engine, but they are more expensive to start with, and there's more that can go wrong. And then if you ever have fun driving it seems like you end up being worse off in terms of mpg than some NA engines.
But for now 32 seems like an impressive achievement."
[Deleted User],Jul-14,"I also owned a Golf ""GT"" Note that it was not a GTI. Which meant that it had the 12 valve engine. I think it was an 85, but I am not sure. I bought it to race with it at a local dirt track against similar powered cars. I was beat by a Fiero 2M4, piloted by my best friend. Mid engine cars handle better I guess, cause I NEVER beat him. Nothing worked on the Jetta but the stereo, and only because I had one lying around. Iron Maiden is essential for relatively low speed dirt racing. I am proud to say that the drivetrain held up well. It still ran when I sold it for scrap after visiting a local tree up close. It was ok though, since the property was closed off after someone got hurt requiring an ambulance, and the cops found out we were racing there. At one point we had 6 cars. It was awesome. Hugely step hills, mud, sand, and hard pack ""road"" with a really long straight. It was really, really, fun."
[Deleted User],Jul-14,"Sorry backy, but I think the sportiest version of the Sonata is still going to be the 2.0T. I get what you mean though, and none of us have talked about it. I wasn't even aware that they made it.
Your last comment is right on the money. I drove a 2015 Optima Turbo and the Mazda 6 back to back 2 weeks ago and they both felt vault like strong. The first thought I had after driving off in the turbo Kia is how much tighter it felt. It drove way better than my car.
So, since the Sonata and the Optima platforms are shared, perhaps those same improvements are in the Sonata chassis."
Michaell,Jul-14,"Hyundai had to do the same thing not long ago with their NA engines .. my Elantra GT is rated at 27/37 (automatic) and I see 28-29 in driving that is about 90% city, 10% highway."
[Deleted User],Jul-14,"I worry about having a turbo in general, especially with a company that has less experience with them. they literally glow red hot. I don't know if the diesel low pressure turbo's do, but I have seen gas turbos run and anything that gets that hot then cold over and over again is eventually going to break. So, I just stay away from them in general. I know manufacturing is much better now, yada yada yada, but I still don't trust them. When I drove the 2015 Optima 2.0T the power output was less than I expected. It wasn't worth getting 10 more thousand in debt over."
Michaell,Jul-14,"Actually, my Elantra is the only NA engine in the family. Both the wife's CX-7 and the daughter's MINI Countryman have turbo engines."
backy,Jul-14,"I think it's the other way around. The 2015 Sonata is the newer design, compared to the current Optima. So maybe the platform strengthening (more high-tensile steel) and suspension tweaks Hyundai put into the new Sonata will be applied to the next-gen Optima.
I was surprised too at the commentary that the 1.6T powertrain on the new Sonata was the sportiest, but maybe it's not too surprising given the 2.0T model is the heaviest of the bunch and the 1.6T has a 7-speed dual-clutch tranny that is likely much more responsive than the 6AT used in all other trims including the 2.0T. Also the 2.0T lost 30 horses from 2014, which according to Hyundai was for improved driveability. But I'll bet it lost some of its sportiness also."
akirby,Jul-14,Ford has tested their ecoboost turbos well past 150K miles. These are not add-on turbos like the 80s - these engines and turbos are designed as a complete package together from the beginning. They also use modern materials like ceramic that don't have the temperature related problems of the early turbos. I'm sure the other mfrs are similar. These are not your grandfather's turbos.
m6user,Jul-14,"Why would there be much difference in weight? 1.6L turbo vs 2.0L turbo should be minimal weight difference, same with transmission. Maybe 50lbs if that?"
rbirns1,Jul-14,"Any recommended VW dealers in the Long Island area? I got a Lexus last year from a NJ dealer that was thousands less than anyone local. Rock bottom price, looking for volume, but took care of me perfectly (registered the car in NY, met me half way for delivery). Maybe there is a similar VW dealer?"
backy,Jul-14,"My guess is, it's not just the engine but all the added equipment that comes with the 2.0T model, as it's at the top end of the Sonata trims. Hyundai's published curb weights are 3270-3296 for the Eco vs. 3505-3616 for the 2.0T.
Also I see that prices are published now for the Eco, and it's a $2,125 premium over the base (SE) trim. That seems like a lot, but it looks like the Eco includes the SE's Preferred Package ($1200) as standard, plus has several available options the SE doesn't have including heated front seats (my wife's 2013 included those in the Preferred Package ). So really less than $1000 for the higher-FE, more responsive turbo. Not too bad I guess."
m6user,Jul-14,That is quite a weight difference. I wonder what can weigh that much more? A sunroof is usually a big weight item but I can't imagine not being able to get a sunroof on the Eco model. I know leather weighs more too. I guess when you add up everything it does add up.
akirby,Jul-14,Stereos (especially subwoofers) can also be really heavy.
ab348,Jul-14,"They probably did what Chevy did with the Cruze Eco: lightweight wheels and tires, fewer body welds, thinner steel, less structure, all sorts of tricks."
dudleyr,Jul-14,"Lightweight wheels and tires yes. They did not cut down on welds or steel thickness, at least not for anything structural. Sometimes the hood is aluminum on lightweight models (my Miata has one) as well as trunk lid."
ab348,Jul-14,"This from a Chevy website:
""Weight (Mass) reduction - The Chevy Cruze Eco has slightly shorter welds and thinner sheetmetal in specific areas. The fuel tank is smaller by three gallons. All in all, the Chevy Cruze Eco weighs between 125 and 188 less than other Chevy Cruze models."""
backy,Jul-14,"Re the Sonata, probably not. Note that the curb weight of the Eco with the 1.6T is about the same as the SE with the 2.4L engine and 6AT. So it doesn't appear Hyundai did any special tricks on the Eco to lighten weight. They just used a smaller (turbo) engine with a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic."
dudleyr,Jul-14,Probably just the hood and trunk and maybe the fenders. If they change the structure the crash tests are not valid. Though I guess you never know with GM. An ignition switch should have been a simple thing.
ab348,Jul-14,And getting a fuel economy rating correct ought to have been really simple for Hyundai.

Platinum VW on Old Country Road in Hicksville. They are a small dealership, but sell A LOT of cars. I helped a friend lease a VW Tiguan about a year & a half ago. I emailed every dealer in the 5 boroughs, Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, & even a couple here in Fairfield County, CT. The salesman was open, honest, knowledgable, & ended up giving my friend the best price."

Michaell,Jul-14,One instance? That does not a pattern make.
ab348,Jul-14,"A 2013 would still be under warranty, so why the quick trigger? Seems a bit of an exaggerated reaction. No car is 100% perfect - things will fail."
ahightower,Jul-14,"""The fuel tank is smaller by three gallons""
I did not know that. Seems a significant compromise. Was that just for weight reduction, or have they done something useful with the space saved? One of the benefits of good fuel economy is supposed to be range, right?
Our old Yukon, though a pig at 14 city, 19 mpg highway (downhill with a tailwind), carried 31 gallons, so could easily go 500 miles per tank on long road trips. Not that the people on board can survive 8 hours without stopping, but you can be more selective about when and especially where to stop, i.e., wait for the cleanest facilities. And even staying around town, I only had to buy gas every 3-4 weeks (if you go to the station that doesn't turn off the pump at $75...)
The Accord has a decent tank at 16 gallons or so. I'm going about 350-375 miles between fill-ups. Haven't had enough experience with the Pathfinder to say. 3rd tank beat the 2nd, but we've been 50/50 city/highway and still below the advertised city mpg. I'll give it time to ""break in"" before making a verdict. And the Big Mouse trip next month will be a real test.
I find it funny how many people think of gas mileage in terms of range. I asked a friend what kind of gas mileage he got in his new Sienna on their trip to New Mexico and he said, ""About 350 miles a tank, only had to fill up once..."" MPG evidently less of an issue than ""MPT"", for some."
dudleyr,Jul-14,"Love the range of my Accord. Always over 500 miles. At 575 right now - with 40 miles of range left. I get close to 700 miles on long trips. Rarely put in $50 as gas is $3.19 now. The extra range means I can totally bypass cities with expensive fuel, or as long as I am within about 300 miles from home I don't have to refuel out of town. Good for the local economy."

I like the Elantra GT.

Mr. Hyundai didn't offer 10 year 100,000 mailer warranties on his products anticipating to pay out all his profits as claims. Hyundai wants to beat Toyota and Honda. That is their goal..... period.

That is why I kept mine down to a box that was small enough to fit right between the shock towers. I would say My dual 10"" MTX box weighs 25lbs max. The two amps weigh about 10 pounds. 4 stock speakers (total crap paper) weighed about a pound each., replaced by 4speakers weighing 1.5 to 2 pounds each.
So let's just say 40 pounds. I would say my new system is on the low and conservative type. About 550 watts RMS is all the power I wanted. I gotta tell you, playing Rush with a subwoofer is amazing. Having a truly good quality speaker system makes a huge difference. I had the Infinity system in my Jeep, as many vehicles do.... Bose does this as well of course, and unfortunately that usually means just adding a powered subwoofer.
With ""A"" pillar tweeters offered on even cheap cars like my moms Forte' EX, tossing in an 8"" paper powered subwoofer and A lot of pretty badges are the only changes needed for most people to believe they have purchased a premium product, when all you get is a Chinese Amp and 1more paper speaker exchanged for lots more of your hard earned paper."

2013 MINI Cooper S 2dr Hatchback (1.6L 4cyl Turbo 6M)
Review
I'm a writer. It's what I do. I've gone looking for the words to say about this car, and I can't find them. I'm instead overtaken by gusts of anger, confusion, and a general bitterness that this prop, this four-wheeled thing parading as a car, has consumed me this wholly. Look elsewhere. Do not get this car. Do not. Get. This car. Just last week I racked up my twelfth (12th) service appointment in 15 months. MINI has dealt with almost every problem I've submitted, aside from the car running out of oil at 5k and a wheel bearing coming off, by repeatedly denying their existence. When they find a given problem, seven service receipts deep, they say it's ""spec.""
Favorite Features
The tweeters loudly crackling. The clutch screeching into first and second gears (""normal""). The high-pitched whine that follows the engine's revs in pitch. The window rolling down, after I pressed to roll it up. The lumbar of my seat has snapped and buckled in under my hefty 165lb frame. There's a squeak coming from paneling near the trunk an engineer said was ""common."" Yet it took them multiple visits to find it? ... I've got a few of 'em on YouTube, even.

This is the model of which I speak. I saw it in the showroom at the Hyundai store across from my Kia dealer (bored during oil change) That was when I first found out that Hyundai makes 3 different models of Elantra' flavor. Is your daughters car a hatchback or sedan?

[Deleted User],Jul-14,"I would buy two. One Optima EX for me and LX for my mother. Both with heated seats.
She bought the 2010 Forte' EX instead. It has never broke down and is still vault like when I take it in for service but it is SO low budge. She could care less. A/C and automatic plus some sort of radio and she is fine.
I hate her steering wheel. It is of such low quality I uttered ""eeew"" when I drove it a while back after getting out of mine.
She drove mine 3 weeks ago and wishes we both knew of the Optima's existence in late 2010, but we didn't.

I drove the crap out of it with many long trips to Canada and to South Carolina, Erie PA, Buffalo. It was a good car, and I believe the engine was ""within spec"", but every time I floored it thick black smoke pour from the exhaust. See, that's what I hate about the ""Big three"" meaning American cars. It was ALWAYS something that didn't work right. Not so with the Asians for the most part. That is why they almost killed our domestic market. Then one of my friends showed up in a brand new $5,000 Hyundai Excel. It was, for a kid in th 11'th grade, an awesome little car. It was better than my American [non-permissible content removed] box in almost every way... we all openly laughed about it, but secretly we thought it was a good little car. The Honda CRX too.

.........I remember an America full of Cavaliers, Sunfires, Sunbird's, Cutlass Ciara's, Buick Skyhawk, Ford Granada's, LTD's Skylark, hell anything with Sky in front of it., (owned 2, ).One burned to the ground outside my girlfriends house, blowing out windows when the tires popped. The car would not run making a left turn, so being a broke 16 year old I just found a way to drive everywhere with right turns!. The fuel line was caught on something, then leaked and ignited in her driveway. I hopped in and got it away from the houses wand ran for the safety of the porch, then when things started exploding we realized our safety was not at all relative there and retreated to the house looking out the window. It burned 2 inches of asphalt off of the ROAD. Very, very bad car. I had an 84 T Type than was very nice though, then there were cars I can barely remember. I had a 87 Olds Tornado Trofeo' whose engine didn't like each others parts so it exploded. I had a $500 beautiful 1990 Cutlass low mileage beauty with the 3.3 liter 160 hp motor. I had it three weeks and was T boned in DC. I hate driving in DC. It is a totally different world from suburban VA.
I tell you guys I have owned over 20 cars, and I hope for 20 more, because I just love the damned automobile in almost every format."
ab348,Jul-14,It had the Saturn plastic body so it was more than a rebadge but it was an Opel platform as I recall.

Sigh."
Michaell,Jul-14,"Yeah, the L-series was a cousin to some Euro-GM cars.
Or, as I liked to say, ""US depreciation with Euro parts costs"".
I had mine for 7+ years and 95,000 miles. It had it's issues - two body control modules failed, at $600 per. Had to rebuild the front brakes at 50K - rotors and calipers - for another $1200.
$25,000 new and I got $3000 in trade for it on the daughter's first MINI."
[Deleted User],Jul-14,"LOL. When I went searching for the one I saw,up popped 2 million pages of aftermarket Elantra dual exhaust kits. I was like ....is that what I saw ?
No. I clung to the hope that I did see GT and dual tip on the same car. But it was not to be. intake.
I confused two models into 1- but all I remembered was the GT label and a chrome exhaust dual tip. Now I know.
Hey on the Mini Countryman guy that was all pissed....there are still bad apples, and mixed with a half crazy [non-permissible content removed]-sapien, out pops crazy letter's about cars falling apart right in front of our eyes, fresh from the dealer who stole our money. Or the ""I'm gonna get you and ruin your good name by exaggerating low quality issues and uncaring dealers. Who knows. I see Mini's all the time.

There is no way I could fit in one. My father-in-law bought one as soon as they came out with the supercharged engine. He sold it in under a year. After piloting F-4's in the Corp's it's hard to get scary speed like that again for realistic dollars. Then he got his BMW Motorcycle, never rode it, and now happily drives a Jeep Liberty of all things? Uggghh"

backy,Jul-14,"Well, I leased it, for 3 years, $47 a month, nothing up front. For a deal like that (trading in a beat-up 2009 Sonata GLS), yes, I'd do it again if I were looking for a mid-sized sedan. But my wife's next vehicle will probably be a small SUV, as she needs a higher entry/exit. I do look forward to driving it, especially on longer trips as it's a nice highway cruiser, and especially in winter with the heated seats. And I still like its looks, in red/camel."

benjaminh,Jul-14,"On another thread someone was looking to replace their 20 year old Accord with a car for less than 5k. The choices listed were things like an Acura and a Lexus from c. 2000 with 150k miles. One of their biggest goals was low maintenance costs. I said I didn't think any of them would be low maintenance, and then trotted out the idea that in the long run (c. 10 years) new can be cheaper than used. For possible interest and debate, here's the made up math for it:
""Say you got the 2000 Acura for 3200, but then spend c. 1500 a year for repairs and maintenance. Perhaps that sounds high to you. And maybe it is. But go to the Edmunds.com true cost to own feature, and plug in a somewhat older luxury car. The oldest Acura TL for which they have estimates is a 2008. And some years they are estimating that this 8 year newer Acura can cost 1500 in repairs and maintenance. And so for a 2000 I think that might be a fair guess.
Anyway, you run it for 5 years x 1500 + purchase cost of 3200 = c. $10k
By the year 2019 it's likely to be dead or dying. Few cars really live well past 20 years imho. That's about the lifespan of a well-engineering and well maintained car in most cases.
So then you buy another 15 year old car. Prices have gone up, and so this 2005 Acura or Lexus costs 6k, but also needs 1500 a year to survive another 5 years. = another c. 13k
So in this scenario maybe you've spent on the used cars and repairs for maintenance c. $23k over ten years
What if instead you got a new Nissan Altima this year. My local dealer recently advertised a base 2014 for about $19k, down from the list of c.$23. Plus Nissan is offering 0 financing over 5 years.
In the short run you are paying more, and that might not be possible. But if it can be done it might work out financially in the long run.
First, maintenance and repairs are drastically less. These days a good new car gets by with relatively little for the first 10 years and 100,000 miles. It comes down to lots of oil changes (50 a pop), tire rotations, a new set of tires, a new set of brake pads, etc. The 2002 Honda Accord I kept for 95k miles had about $2000 maintenance (and no repairs) in the 8 years I owned it.
What if we said 3k for the Altima over ten years. That would add up to $22k.
At first it seems like it's about a tie: 23k for used and 22k for new.
But then factor in mpg. The 2000 Acura costs about $2950 a year to fuel according to the EPA. A 2014 Altima costs about $1750 to fuel. That's a difference of $1200 a year, which over a decade adds up to $12,000.
Suddenly new is looking like it can pay in the long run.
Then add in resale. By the time your 2000 Acura gets to 2019 my guess is that it'll basically go to the junkhard. Maybe you'll get a 1000 for it. Ditto for the next old car sold when it's really old. I've been there. They just aren't worth much. I donated my 1988 Olds 98 in 2008 to Goodwill.
So, maybe $2000 resale going old used.
By 2024, however, it's likely a 2014 Altima will still have some value. 7k? Who knows. But it'll still have some life in it.
Finally, there's your time and energy. I spent so many hours at mechanics and in garages with my old cars. It was not only expensive, but stressful, and just took a lot of time. What a waste. I wish, in retrospect, I'd just taken the plunge sooner to get a good new car, rather than limping along for years with a series of bad old cars that....Well, you get the idea.
Plus a new car is safer and has features a 2000 Acura or Lexus couldn't dream of, like bluetooth.
Sorry this is so long."""
[Deleted User],Jul-14,"Just heard on the news Mini Cooper Countryman is the only car to get ""Good"" rating from IIHS out of 13 cars on the small frontal offset test or what have you.
So, there we have it. One man says junk, but reality is that the Cooper is as well made as any other new car IMHO.
I know tis is mid size, but did you guys know that the base engine on the mini is a 1.5 liter 3 cyl (turbo)?
Then the S is a 2.0 T, and you would be correct that they just add a cylinder."
benjaminh,Jul-14,"It's nice to see such good crash test scores on the MINI. And now that they have BMW rather than Peugeot-engineered engines they are probably more reliable. It still seems like a compelling car to me, but ending up dead last in the JDP Dependability study seemed like a clear warning to informed consumers....
The sad thing about that new IIHS crash test is that the Mazda5 essentially failed. I used to own a Mazda5, but traded it in for our 2013 Accord. But four years ago when my sister was car shopping, I recommended the Mazda5 and she got it. Yikes. I forwarded the video to her with apologies and recommended she consider a Subaru Forester (if she still wants a wagon) or an Accord if she's willing to go sedan."
akirby,Jul-14,I don't think you would average $1500/year in repairs unless that also includes tires and maintenance (which would also be required on a new car).
backy,Jul-14,"First, a correction to a couple of earlier posts from me re my lease on a 2013 Sonata: I traded in a 2007 Sonata GLS, pretty beat up, needing new tires... not a 2009.
Second, re the post on getting a new Altima for around $19k vs. a used car... on that same thought, within the past few days I've seen ads for both a new 2014 Optima LX and a 2014 Sonata GLS for $17k. Also I often see ads for base model Fusions for around $17k, even a little less with all incentives (some of which not every buyer may qualify for of course). All very nice cars at a great price. Of those, my pick would be the Optima LX. And another benefit of the Optima and Sonata is they have the 5-year bumper-to-bumper warranty, 2 years longer than on the Altima, Fusion, and most other mid-sized cars. And if you find the right dealer (as I did with my wife's Sonata), you might even get some goodies tossed in like free oil changes."
Mr_Shiftright,Jul-14,"I don't think there was ever much debate among owners that a Mini Cooper was a sturdy, solidly-built little car. You can tell that from the first minute you sit in one and drive it.
The problem as I see it as an owner is that this ""little, fun car"" costs as much as a Porsche to drive and maintain. And that is not an idle comment--I've priced out maintenance and parts back to back and it's very close indeed.
I hope as MINIs get BIGGER, they get BETTER, and also cheaper to operate."
benjaminh,Jul-14,"1500 might be on the high side, but yes that was meant to include everything—tires, maintenance, and repairs. And that's meant to be an average for a 15 year old luxury car. Obviously some years it might be just be a few hundred, but other years you might run into thousands of dollars."
benjaminh,Jul-14,"Yeah, part of the dream of the MINI for me it's that it's almost the middle-class person's BMW. It is in terms of msrp, but in terms of maintenance and repairs Shiftright's experience seems like a warning at this point."
Mr_Shiftright,Jul-14,"If you average it out for a number of years, and if you don't do your own work, or scrounge used parts, or buy the cheapest imaginable parts, I bet that's pretty accurate.
I mean, just brakes and tires is an easy $1K. Or overhauling an AC unit--that's pricey. Timing belts on a V-6 ain't cheap, and clutch work on a FWD car can be labor intensive."
[Deleted User],Jul-14,"....and the Mining ins distinctly European... but is kind of a mutt now, Just like us, after invention by the British,"
Mr_Shiftright,Jul-14,"Well I have an early MINI, so the later turbo models are improved I am told. I don't expect the repair and maintenance costs to have improved however."
benjaminh,Jul-14,Have you started to think about your next car? And is a MINI on the list?
Mr_Shiftright,Jul-14,"I am actively hunting for a clean Porsche 996 coupe, so no mid-size sedans in my immediate future unless I go for a second car. If I were shopping, I'd probably shop VW, BMW or (gasp) a Fiesta ST. (no wait, that last one isn't midsized, is it?)"
akirby,Jul-14,But the cost of tires and brakes and regular maintenance is the same whether it's a new car or old car so you'd have to add some of that $1500 to the new car cost as well.
[Deleted User],Jul-14,"Sighted: Driving home with my daughter after shopping, we both notice a green 98 Camry bumbling down my main street. Well what made it weird you say? It was missing the hood, both fenders, 1 headlight and bezel assembly. In other words, 3/4 of a Camry.
My daughter said: maybe he could only afford 3/4 of a car. LOL,"
Mr_Shiftright,Jul-14,"true enough but with a used car you don't often start off even with a new car in terms of tires or brakes...you ""inherit"" a certain amount of wear and tear on both ""expendables"" like tires and brakes, and on regular components as well."
benjaminh,Jul-14,"I tried to do that. But in my experience most old cars have somewhat worn brakes and tires. They often need to be replaced in the first year or so of ownership. A new car is free of that for about the first 5-6 years. in 2002 I bought a new Accord LX. Aside from lots of oil changes, tire rotations, etc., the main things needed were a new set of tires at about 60k miles and a new set of brake pads. No repairs were needed in c. 95,000 miles of ownership. It didn't even need a tune-up. I think the total for maintenance following the factory schedule was about $2000 over 8 years, including the tires and brake pads."
m6user,Jul-14,"One word for the old vs. new. Depends. It depends on the quality and condition of the used car. Some used cars come with new tires and brakes so you can't just automatically assume they will be an expense right off the bat. On the flip side, even newer cars have their problems.. I just read the other day that the new Chevy Silverado has had something like a recall a month for every month it's been out. Not expensive but surely a huge hassle. I would guess that some people have more time than money and on average a used car will be less expensive mainly because of the huge depreciation hit.
Now if you compared a low mileage 3 yr old used car to a new one the used car would win easily I think for cost of ownership over 5 years or more."

................................................................................................................................................................
Buying a new vehicle is one of the worst investments we could make financially. With there depreciation values , Bad roads , and drivers. Guys like us that buy every 3 or 4 years are the ones paying the price. its lots of fun but gets you in the pocket. I know many people who will only buy a 3 or 4 yr old vehicle. They are the ones saving money.. Buying a 3yr old Bmw, Mb, or Audi will save you big time.
I just helped someone trade back a 2011 Hyundai Sonata limited to dealer . He paid 27k traded back to dealer for 15k.. Nice hit for a 3 year drive"
ab348,Jul-14,"I dunno, seems like buying a 3 year old BMW, Mercedes or Audi is about the worst possible thing to do. Warranty runs out when all the repairs start to be needed. And those are expensive repairs on those."
brian125,Jul-14,I agree these cars are expensive to maintain when they get older or out of warranty.. Vehicles are being made a lot better today than years ago. On the topic of above mention cars your talking about saving 25 to 30k on certain models. So from a money stand point its a much better buy. wouldn't you agree. I was not not talking about keeping any of these cars for more than 6 or 7 years .
dudleyr,Jul-14,"I guess I am just lucky, but my 2007 Accord with 175k miles has been close to maintenance free. Other than tires and oil it has needed 1 O2 sensor, rear brake pads and spark plugs. Less than $200.
Tires and oil are basically the same for old and new cars. Most used cars (especially at dealers) either have new tires, or the price is reduced to make up the the tires being old.
I replaced the plugs at 120k with irridium and the originals still looked fine, but I already had the new ones so I changed them anyway. The rear brakes only wore out because the the brake cable hit a rock and rusted shut when I parked it for a week (out of town of course), so I was driving with the rear brakes on until I got home and detached the e-brake.
Clutch and front brakes are still original and still have lots of life left. 34.9 lifetime mpg on top of all that. The car has been good to me.
I will add that the newer DI engines may not last as long (I expect my 2007 to go 300-400k miles as the top of the engine still looks new - all synthetic oil diet). My '13 Accord needed a quart of oil at about 7,500 miles. My '07 is only down a few tenths at 10,000. Also the tailpipe looks brand new on my '07 and my '13 has a very light coat of soot. I think as engines get pushed more and more for power and mpg they will lose some durability.
My brother has over 350k miles on a 95 Infinity G-20. No major problems and routine maintenance. I am not so sure this will be as common with a small turbo direct injection engine that many midsizers are moving towards."

akirby,Jul-14,Slight difference - with unused hotel rooms or plane seats there is no additional cost and there is no impact on the vendor's ability to sell that seat or room the next flight or the next day. With a car if you sell below cost it's a loss and you lose the possibility of a profitable sale the next day or week or month. Apples and oranges.
m6user,Jul-14,Not really. If you sell enough hotel rooms or plane seats below cost it would put you out of business just as it would a car dealer. A dealer selling one car below cost can make it up the next day by selling a car well over cost. Happens all the time. Airlines adjust fares almost daily. Dealers sell cars at different margins daily. Everyone that sells something is subject to the laws of supply and demand.
akirby,Jul-14,"Dealers are only give a specific number of vehicles to sell so lost profit on that vehicle is lost forever. If you don't sell it today below cost you can sell it tomorrow above cost. With a hotel room, selling it at low cost today has no impact on selling it at a higher cost the next day or week."

2015 Acura TLX sets new benchmark for mid level sport luxury performance
A tall order but Acura engineering has achieved something that automotive manufacturers can only hope to achieve. They’ve set the new manufacturing benchmark for a very competitive automotive segment. The 2015 TLX will change the way that you perceive economy-driven luxo- performance.
prom·i·nence
the fact or condition of standing out from something by physically projecting or being particularly noticeable.
Acura engineering has manifested in the form of the 2015 TLX Sport Sedan what most automotive manufactures only inspire to do. They’ve produced a quality, financially attainable, sports performing, user friendly automotive transformer. Offered in several variants, including a top of the segment(all-new) 3.5 Liter V6 powered performance sedan, TLX takes tech-driven performance to a new level, while establishing a fuel efficiency, drive-performance and safety benchmark for the segment.
No manufacturer in the segment can match or exceed 2015 TLX performance at this price point.
Acura, through TLX offers an exceptional road-handling midsize Sport Sedan that performs as well on the twisties as many European sport coupes, while providing the interior comfort and quiet of a luxury sedan. And, has done so while establishing a beginning MSRP slightly higher than the top of the line 2014 Honda Accord.
We can’t say enough about the Acura’s newest offering. We believe that this performance sport sedan will change the way that our readers and world-car manufacturers perceive and measure driving performance, while supporting low emission levels and exceptional fuel economy through extreme form meets function and safety driven automotive design.
While we can’t comment on our driving experience until next week, we will state the following with strong conviction: We find no compromise of quality evident in our close review of the 2015 TLX and look excitedly forward to reporting on the driving attributes of Acura’s game changer. This car is contagiously spirited.
Designed, supplied and built in America, Acura TLX furthers Honda Motors and Acura Division’s intent to return the mark to North American prominence in all segments. While Acura TLX will not do everything, what it does do, it does exceptionally well. We’re proud to report that Acura has hit a homerun in designing the TLX. Stay tuned for daily updates as we present the car that will return Acura to segment dominance; the Acura 2015 TLX."""
akirby,Aug-14,That's not a review - it's an Acura press release.
benjaminh,Aug-14,"True! lol
But to me the TLX does seem like a compelling possibility in this category. I think the full reviews come out on Monday.
Compared to an Accord EXL, the entry-level TLX is only $2700 more. Midsize luxury or ""near-luxury"" midsize sedans from other manufacturers start at more like $40k or more. And so, unless I'm missing something, this might be the only one that overlaps in price with high end Sonatas, Fusions, Accords, etc."
ab348,Aug-14,"But the ones that overlap have a NA 4-banger and are unlikely to feel very high-end. Let's wait and see.
I agree, whomever posted the article referenced ought to be ashamed to call themselves a journalist."
akirby,Aug-14,"For the same base price as the 3.5L TLX, you can get a 3.7L MKZ with real leather instead of leatherette, more power and I think the MKZ is bigger. Nothing earth shattering here."
suydam,Aug-14,"Not a word about fuel economy except to say its ""good"", whatever that means."
benjaminh,Aug-14,"The TLX with the 2.4 and standard 8-speed DC transmission is rated 24 city, 35 hwy, and 28 combined.
http://www.acura.com/TLXLanding.aspx
The info is found when you expand the trim level area at the bottom of the page."
akirby,Aug-14,My Fusion Titanium which is larger with WAY more power is rated 22/33/26 so those numbers are not that impressive for a simple 4 banger.
benjaminh,Aug-14,"It's not meant to be earth-shattering, just another option to consider when thinking about midsize for less than 35k.
For some of us, like myself, Ford products are not on the shopping list—just like for other people Honda/Acura products aren't on the shopping list.
It's good we have choices. The TLX is just one more to add to a very rich mix of good cars in this segment."
m6user,Aug-14,"@akirby‌
Your Fusion is about 1 inch longer and the same width and weighs only 26 more pounds more than the new TLX. So yes it larger but c'mon, that is hyperbole. It's virtually the same size. Yeah, the TLX's MPG is not world shattering MPG but for an entry level luxury midsize car it's pretty decent. It's the entry level. More power is available in the v-6.
I kind of feel your pain though. Seems someone here feels the marketing department at Honda needs help.
The statement about luxury cars starting at $40k and above is just plain exaggeration. Plenty of luxury brand entry models start in the low to mid $30ks. ES350 starts at a little more than $37k, a BMW 328 starts at about $37k(the 320 is even lower), an A4 starts at less than $34k, the MKZ starts at about $35k. The InfinitiQ50 starts at about $37k with over 300hp.
I own an Acura RDX and like it, but that doesn't make the new TLX the best thing since sliced bread. Nor is it the cheapest near luxury or even luxury entry out there."
benjaminh,Aug-14,"Actually the Fusion is significantly bigger inside than a TLX.
Interior room Fusion: 102.8
Interior room TLX: 93.3
akirby is correct!++
And I think his ecoboost 2.0 would spank a TLX 2.4 to 60.
A Fusion Titanium 2.0 is a truly awesome car in many ways.
(It's just my bad experiences from long ago keep me personally from considering it at this time.)"

Thanks for the info.
And I stand corrected on prices on luxury and near-luxury cars. Sorry about that! I meant to say midsize cars, but didn't put that in. I've now corrected it. Must need another cup of coffee.
But I'm not saying the TLX is the greatest thing since sliced bread! I was just posting someone else's ""review""—which I admitted sounded like an Acura press release.
But I still think that starting at $31k the TLX might be a car to potentially consider at the upper end of the midsize price-spread. It's just one of many good options to consider, including the Lincoln MKZ and the Fusion Titanium 2.0, as well as a top end Mazda6.
Peace folks."

I actually said he was correct but barely. We were talking about MPG and he mentioned that the Fusion was larger which insinuates that that fact would naturally affect MPG. The Fusion is only 26 more lbs than the new TLX and an inch longer. A lot of things affect MPG but I don't think that having more interior room does.

benjaminh,Aug-14,"A mixed to positive review of the new Acura TLX from Autoweek. The sum-up:
""If you enjoy being behind the wheel and if most of your driving does not involve spirited apex-bashing on challenging roads, this car will meet your needs. The infotainment connectivity is on par with the best in the class, the 10-speaker ELS Studio Premium Audio or even the 7-speaker premium audio is superbly distinct and there are zillions of ways to get music into them. The NAV and audio systems are a lot easier and more intuitive to use than BMW’s or Mercedes’. And the styling, while not being overly distinctive, is not as far-fetched as some earlier Acura offerings....""

Just got a very good review (83 score) from Consumer Reports. They also reviewed the S60, which is on the smallish side for mid-sized but still I think an alternative. I recently saw an ad for a 36-month sign-and-drive lease on the S60 with leather and moonroof for $289/month, including all maintenance. I doubt one could find a lease on a similarly-equipped ""regular"" mid-sized car for the same money."
ab348,Aug-14,I can vouch for the Regal. But I do wish GM would push it more. Incentives on it tend to be few and far between as compared to other GM cars.
ab348,Aug-14,That surprises me a bit as Ford lately has done a poor job of interior space efficiency in the Taurus and the Focus. The Fusion looks narrow to me so I'm surprised by the amount of space claimed.
m6user,Aug-14,"Maybe they measure it the same way they measure some of their MPGs. LOL.
On the Regal. I have always really admired the looks of the new Regal as it reminds me a little bit of the Infiniti G but every time I sit in one at the auto show I'm less impressed with the interior space and layout. Also, the trunk isn't very big or at least wasn't shaped in a way that it looked like it would hold a lot. I actually like the Verano better."
explorerx4,Aug-14,I just read a story about a car publication that has a Fusion Titanium with 19 inch wheel package like mine. Someone stole all 4 and left the car up on a couple of bricks. Replacement cost: $4300!
Michaell,Aug-14,Which the insurance company paid for?
m6user,Aug-14,Same thing happened to my then fiance and it was a 1980 Camaro Berlinetta. $800 total. Inflation.
brian125,Aug-14,"I was reading ratings and reviews which stated the Buick Regal is a poor- mans 3 series BMW. The Regal has received some nice reviews. I'm not versed on the Buick line but a quick turbo engine in that vehicle may persuade someone on a budget to buy it. I'd like to see the Buick Regal on the Chevy impala platform in terms of more room and size. I have not drove a 3 series BMW in the past two years but what bothered me about the 3 is on bad nyc roads your bouncing all over the place.. a annoying ride I don't like anymore. The regal may hold the bumps better but again I'm just assuming.
@ab348... I'd like to hear your take on the Regals suspension older, and newer models.
I also like the look of the regal. my #1 drawback is.... interior size... Not big guy friendly.

It would be plenty big inside for my needs (or my wife's needs). FE just not that good, however, compared to most mid-sized sedans. And not really a fit for either my next vehicle (as I prefer small hatchbacks) or my wife's (will probably get a small SUV for her for ease of entry/exit)."

The T-Type I had was very handsome inside and out, while the same Chevy J body was horrible inside. I think Buick has always tried Tom be better than the rest of GM, without being gaudy and garish for the most part. I think they were hobbled at GM more than helped at times.
So, I totally believe that the Verano is a compelling car for them. Especially the turbo."
[Deleted User],Aug-14,
ab348,Aug-14,"@brian125 - I have a 2011 Regal Turbo so that is all I can really comment upon. I did drive a NA 2.4 2011 before I bought the Turbo and it was OK but I did not think it had enough power for the way I like to drive. The current Turbo is more powerful than mine so I think it would be even better than what I have but I am satisfied with mine. I was attracted to the Regal because of the styling, which I think looks great, and the size of the car. I generally like bigger cars but don't really need one.
So, with all that - I love the suspension and handling on mine. I have driven German cars previously and owned a VW GTi in the '90s and this definitely has that taut Germanic feel. But I do not find the ride at all rough. It is not traditional Buick-soft (I came out of a 1st-gen Lacrosse so I know what that is like) but is still comfortable and well-controlled. It handles very nicely and I have zero complaints about the way it drives. In fact I have had it on a number of day-long highway drives and it is without doubt the best car I have ever owned for that kind of travel - set the cruise on 75 and it just tracks like it is hunkered down to the road.
In terms of interior size: I am 6' but am a big guy. I take a 2XL shirt and a 44 pant. The car fits me fine but there is no extra room (except legroom). But having said that I am very comfortable in it. It is at best a 4 seater and I have had 4 adults in it for some distance with no complaints. If the front seats are not rearward to the max you can be quite comfortable in the rear compartment. The trunk is OK but slopes upward slightly towards the passenger compartment which is a bit of an issue with large items. One golf bag is no problem but two requires some maneuvering. I find the room issue a bit odd because the car is fairly wide so I don't know where it all goes.
Downsides for me are that it takes some finagling to get the front seats adjusted comfortably. Compared to the cushy lounge chair buckets in my Lacrosse these are harder seats and the bottom cushion isn't as big. I have them adjusted so I am comfortable but the old-style seats in the Lacrosse seemed easier to make fit me better, even though they didn't provide as much support and didn't have a lumbar support like these do. That's pretty much my only gripe. I really like the size of the car in driving it, not too big, not too small. It just feels right. It has enough power especially on the highway - it will go way too fast way too quickly - and ample torque around town. I really do like it. Will a Turbo 4 be troublesome down the road? That is really the only lingering question I have. I have not had a Turbo engine before so I have no experience to go on."

benjaminh,Aug-14,"midsize sales for July
Camry: 39,888
Accord: 35,073
Altima: 26,654
Fusion: 23,942
Sonata: 22,577
Optima: 13,588
Malibu: 13,537
Passat: 8,668
200: 8,159
Mazda6: 5,049
Legacy: 4,679"
benjaminh,Aug-14,"Nissan probably now has the capacity to make 35,000 Altimas a month. Ditto with Ford and the Fusion. But so far they rarely get close to that. I mistakenly thought that by now we'd be having a 4 way race at the top. But the rankings have been remarkably steady. It seems that no one is likely to topple the Camry in the foreseeable future. And the Accord seems quite solid in the # 2 slot. With Altima sales slumping a bit (down last month 10% compared to last year) and Fusion up 17% compared to last year, there does seem to be something of a battle for 3rd place.
The Passat, down 14% from last year's weak numbers, continues to be a letdown for VW. They are now running at about half capacity at their TN factory. Given that the market as a whole is doing well, and the Passat has a new turbo engine and higher mpg, it really seems puzzling. Plus Passat has the only turbo diesel in a mainstream midsize sedan iirc.
Mazda6 sales, in contrast, were up a big 46% compared to the year ago period. The 6 seems to be getting some good traction in the market. I think it would be a big upset if the 6 passed the Passat for the 2015 model year. I think that's possible."
akirby,Aug-14,Don't Accord sales include coupes and crosstours? Toyota is hell bent on keeping the sales lead and seems willing to use incentives and fleet sales to do it. Remember the last time a car company did that?
m6user,Aug-14,It's nice to see Mazda6 sales up dramatically but IIRC they were almost nonexistent last year because of lack of supply coming from Japan. So the comparison to last year is probably an easy one right now.
stickguy,Aug-14,I am quite curious to see how the Legacy #s trend once the new model is fully available. I hope that the upgrades can get it to nearly double. At least ahead of the Passat.
backy,Aug-14,Maybe. But a new Passat is coming next year. It's a big game of leap-frog.
Mr_Shiftright,Aug-14,"Also new Mazda6 diesel, to compete with Passat TDI I'd imagine. First Japanese competitor for the TDI."
m6user,Aug-14,Don't hold your breath on the Mazda6 diesel. I heard from my dealer that they were having problems meeting U.S. requirements and they are selling the gasser model in good enough quantities to maintain production lines in Japan. Unless you've got some good solid info to the contrary I'd be all ears.
[Deleted User],Aug-14,I don't know Chrysler has still sold 8100 crappy 200 cars. That has to be fleet sales.
brian125,Aug-14,"For the first half of last year, more than half of all Chrysler 200 sedans were sold as fleet vehicles. No wonder it's widely seen as the official car of the rental lot. And it's doubtful those fleet sales did anything to help Chrysler in the long run. Very few people who shelled out $20 or 30 per day for the displeasure of driving a 200 later plunked down $20,000 for the displeasure of owning one. The new 2015 200 s has a bigger motor/ awd. Still not up to par with the class leaders in its field."
[Deleted User],Aug-14,"8100 was just too clean a number. While rental plots are full of Sebring's and 200's, they are also used by the government. Social Service's here use them, and they are conspicuous sometimes because I will notice that a car has hubcaps and small wheels that are only offered by order just to keep tire costs down. Our government sells the cars after 125k and 5 years.."
backy,Aug-14,"It was good enough to top the Accord Sport in the most recent M/T mid-sized sedan comparo. Also the Altima and Malibu. (Fusion didn't participate.) Since Chrysler's top two targets with the 200 are the Fusion and Malibu, that's a good start."
ab348,Aug-14,"Well, it's new, and we all know how the car magazines usually fall over themselves for a newly-introduced car. I can't understand why Chrysler would target the Malibu. It's not exactly burning up the sales charts."
Mr_Shiftright,Aug-14,"I think I got the info from one of the ""greencar"" websites but on what authority, who knows?
The problem for automakers is that they have to be able to sell the diesels in California--a huge market. I think in a few years government attitudes about diesels will lighten up and they may even get the same privileges as hybrids do.
So I think there's room in this market for Mazda, definitely."
m6user,Aug-14,"Oh, I think there is room all right. I think a lot of people would like to try a Japanese diesel. All they have really had is the VW in mainstream smaller cars in recent years. Luxury cars, different story."
Mr_Shiftright,Aug-14,Modern diesel cars are great for zipping around metro areas. You get all that oomph right off the line. The only time they really don't work is if your commute is very short and the diesel engine doesn't get to warm up thoroughly. They aren't efficient when they are below optimum operating temperatures.
[Deleted User],Aug-14,"Do we have a Malibu driver? I am seeing Malibu ad's framing the page here, and it specifically says Chevy Malibu on our little home here. Just wondering if they wooed anyone over. I like their rear stance, and I even like the rear end where I can see two muffler's; but no fancy dual exhaust tips. Kind of like ""I have it, but I'm not gonna show just anyone."""
backy,Aug-14,"I guess that's why the Optima--introduced several years ago--took 2nd, ahead of the brand-new 200.
Why target the Malibu? First, because it's an easier target than the likes of the Accord and Camry. Second, even though the Malibu isn't burning up the sales charts, it sells in much bigger numbers than the 200."
[Deleted User],Aug-14,"What I aim saying is that for the amount of sales they have, on top of the advertising dollars supplied to get built in advertising here on Edmunds, plus the NASCAR exposure including being tied to the likes of Dale Earnhardt, I am surprised we don't have a Malibu owner here ravenously defending his mount's honor, even though under the skin they have nothing in common. Stickers as headlights? I think the cars should be more realistic to be honest.
Or, maybe they are out racing while I sit in the A/C online babbling about Malibu's."

[Deleted User],Aug-14,"The 2014 Kia Optima Turbo drove very closely to the Mazda 6 I tested on the same day. I think mine has ""loosened up"" over time, but it starts every day and has consistently provided a nice, reliable, warm or cold as necessary transportation module, but no it doesn't drive as well as the Mazda 6. It is actually hard for me to remember what my car felt like when it was new vs. now. It was one heck of a lot tighter than the Jeep G/C I came out of. Progress.
What I said about the 2014 Optima means that I think they reprogrammed the weld robots or used better Steel or a combination of the two for a stiffer platform, and new premium tires on a fresh platform. No wonder people buy a new car at around 30,000 miles, and my dealer slapped a ""certified"" sticker on my paperwork if I sell it between now and 2000 more miles."
m6user,Aug-14,"Yeah, like Mazda has enough spare change to pay anybody off. LOL."
backy,Aug-14,"I got my first look at the new Sonata today, as I checked them out at my local Hyundai dealer. They were closed so I didn't get to sit in one, but I thought the exterior looked more ""grown up"" than the prior generation car. I liked the looks of the SE (now the base model) better than the higher-end trims, which have too much chrome trim for my taste. Every SE seemed to have the Popular Equipment package on it ($1200), which has a lot of stuff but not heated front seats as on my wife's 2013. In fact I don't know if you can even get heated seats on the SE. The interior looked very spacious, and the materials looked fine except for the trim around the HVAC controls, which was a cheap-looking silver plastic. The center stack controls looked dumb-simple--big improvement over the old model.
This dealer also had tons of 2014 Sonatas (and Elantras). Looks like a good time to get a deal on a 2014. I noticed the 2014 Sonatas had a sticker discount on the PEP that made it only $900, and it includes goodies like a backup camera and heated front seats. So a pretty well-equipped car for ~$23k list... can probably get it for under $18k these days."

benjaminh,Aug-14,"More or less. But it's a little more complicated than that. The write-up from autoblog says:
http://www.autoblog.com/2014/08/04/2015-acura-tlx-first-drive-review/
""Before jumping behind the wheel and covering hundreds of miles in all three models combined, Acura showed me a fullsize cutaway of its new sedan. The display allowed me to see for myself that the TLX is built on the same basic platform as the Honda Accord, but it is significantly different, having been updated for premium duty with additional high-strength hot stamped steel to improve rigidity and safety, along with aluminum alloy and magnesium componentry to reduce weight. Once satisfied with the platform's enhanced body stiffness and lowered mass, the engineering team shot acoustic foam into the body cavities, adhered acoustic barrier panels within the body panels, used triple door seals around the frames...""
""The interior, in terms of design and execution, reminds me of the recently released RLX, which is Acura's current flagship....""
""...the engine is mated to a standard eight-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT) with a torque converter. Yes, a torque converter. The automaker has combined its DCT with a torque converter – the industry's first such marriage we're aware of – to improve smoothness in stop-and-go situations and enhance off-the-line acceleration, both areas of weakness with many dual-clutch gearboxes...""
""....The Acura is remarkably quiet for a vehicle in this segment. The chassis and ride is also superb in all models....the TLX will make its owners look forward to the daily commute, whether three miles or three hours...""
""I'm a sport sedan guy, and given that primary motive, I'd likely choose the BMW 328i as this segment's most engaging, sportiest and fun-to-drive model – but option-for-option, it's significantly costlier to purchase and own, especially once BMW's free maintenance program expires. And besides, in the real world, people rarely drive above six-tenths. The reality is that most buyers in the segment are actually seeking an attractive vehicle with an accommodating cabin, comfortable ride, sporty-feeling yet predictable handling, a long equipment list, strong crash test scores, impeccable reliability, fuel economy and a price that doesn't break the bank.....Acura has engineered a much better sedan than its TSX and TL ever were – and it's finally in a position to offer a much better, more properly focused luxury sedan than most others in the segment."""

backy,Aug-14,"That's an easy question for me because the lease for our 2013 Sonata runs through November 2015. At that point, I'll bet there'll be good discounts on the 2015 Sonata.

Acura has toned that down and now it's too conservative. Just goes to show you how different tastes interpret design. I haven't seen any car here that we discuss routinely that I wouldn't buy simply because of the exterior design. There are about 50 other things I consider more important. Now if one of them looked like the Aztec or Crosstour or something like that I would have to pass just due to the ugliness."

Is that a fact something you know is a fact or are you just throwing out an assumption. Could it be that it was just part of the design? I have never heard that the size of the pass thru is a direct result of needed structural bracing.
As far as being based on a Accord frame and the motor tuned up. The Lexus ES350 is built directly on the Avalon frame and uses the exact same drivetrain. I believe the MKC is built directly on the Escape frame. So what? All manufacturers share subcomponents."

Michaell,Aug-14,"I've been driving a Nissan Altima rental while my car is in the shop getting some work done. My thoughts and impressions after a few days (copied from the CCBA thread).
I've done a couple of delivery shifts in it now and have a bit more of an opinion on my likes and dislikes.
First, I really like the keyless entry and push button start. One less thing I have to fumble with as I'm getting food into the car. Quite convenient.
It's spacious and quiet riding, for the most part. With 34,000 miles on it, there are a few squeaks and moans when I go over bumps. The brakes squeal a bit from time to time.
No feel at all through the steering wheel. I'm glad my Hyundai has the button that allows me to (artificially) boost the feel. This thing is dead. I'm noticing the same feeling when I drive the wife's CX-7, too. Geez, I hope that someone, somewhere, has maintained steering feel in their cars.
Handles like a pig. I know, it's a mid-sized sedan, but I could get the front wheels to screech even at moderate speeds. Low resistance Michelins are to blame?
Still getting used to the CVT - after my experience in the Sonata Hybrid rental I had in CA, this feels very different.
Infotainment sucks. No USB, no satellite radio. Choices are AM/FM or an AUX jack for my iPod.
Good gas mileage, however. If I'm reading the dashboard right, this tank has gone over 500 miles already and there is still over 100 miles left to empty. MPG computer shows 26.3 - don't know if that's a lifetime number or just for this tank. I got the car with just over a 1/2 tank of gas in it and I've done close to 200 miles already. I'll probably have to put gas in it, as I learned that the E-GT will be in the shop until Monday."

[Deleted User],Aug-14,"4 series ""Gran Coupe?"" Oh my god, I wasn't even aware that existed. BMW seems to have every niche product with no end in sight... this is what I meant in an earlier post. Even I would be intimidated if I walked on to their lot. I thought the 4 series was invented denoting a 2 door car! Someone oven there is behind this BMW branding blitz, and I am starting to wonder if he is insane.
I actually hate to keep the entry level luxury sedan posts going, but I have been on the Fairfax BMW e-mailing list forever from when I had my old 320 serviced there, and I just got a mailer featuring over 50 328i cars, all slashed to $33,575. That is a seriously good price on a $50,000 car! I have no idea if any of them come with ""available"" features like seats and steering wheels, but $33k for a car that does 60 in 5.8 seconds and the quarter in 13.9 at 101. Very quick for a 4 cylinder in such a big car.
If I was in the market for a loaded mid size sedan, I think I would add this long established BMW dealer on my short list for a test drive. It would probably come down to me buying the Mazda 6 or moving up to a low end BMW, with insurance and taxes being the deal breaker on the B-Mer.
As long as it isn't a 320. Been there done that."
backy,Aug-14,"Another way to move up a bit is with the Regal. I saw a great deal on the Regal Turbo in my local paper yesterday: $219/month for 36 months, no money down + TTL and first payment. That's a better deal than something like an Accord LX. Although the lease rates on those have dropped recently due to a $500 incentive. Weird thing about Honda ads in my area--they NEVER advertise sale prices, just lease rates.
A few other mid-sizers advertised great deals yesterday, e.g. a new Fusion S for $16,500. It seems to me these super-low prices are coming a little earlier in the year than in the past. It used to be you'd only see the low-low prices in the fall, with the best deals around Thanksgiving to year-end."
[Deleted User],Aug-14,"In the back of the new (9/14) issue of Car and Driver, there is a graph of RETAIL sales numbers through April this year. The source of these numbers is IHS Automotive with POLK new-vehicle registration data. It is located on page 128, in the middle of a Honda Accord Sport (manual) long term test. It returned 29 mpg, did 0-60 in 6.6 seconds when new AND after 40,000 miles, No problems except 3 unscheduled brake rotor resurfacing trips to the dealer, and we all know it was driven hard by C/D staff.
They loved it, but missed the lack of heated seats, SAT radio and navigation, and leather. Stated it is an extremely good value at $24k.

maxamillion85,Aug-14,"Alright folks, come Labor Day weekend I'm going to be ready to pull the trigger on a Fusion. I've been in talks with a few dealerships around the country (Some in Chicago-land and Illinois, two in NJ and one in CT)
Before this morning I was pretty set on driving to Columbia Ford out in Columbia, Connecticut to pick up a Fusion model they have available.
It's a loaded Darkside model with Charcoal Interior with the following options:
-6spd manual transmission
-202A/Luxury pkg
-Driver Assist pkg
-Heated Steering Wheel
-Power Moonroof
-MFT/Navigation
-Reverse Sensing System
-18 inch black gloss alloy wheels
Got a dealer quote late last night for $29200 prior to any rebates which comes out to about $340 above invoice. Currently I qualify for rebates up to $4750 if I take the Ford financing ($3750 if I don't) so the total cost as of last night was about $25,500-$24500 depending on rebates. I was about to plan the trip out there today when I got a call from the dealership (which is open on Sunday surprisingly) and now I'm putting the brakes on the purchase.
Part of the deal I acquired last night was to include splash guards and some all-weather mats in the price of the car, and today the salesperson agreed to do that since the car is still over invoice a bit. Then before we ended the conversation he told me that the dealership charges a $498 ""Conveyance"" fee for all purchases which he says is required by law (I just researched it and the only thing the dealership is required to do is post a sign saying they charge these fees and what they charge. Its a charge the dealerships themselves comes up with but he made it seem like it was a one-time fee all dealerships charge that Connecticut themselves requires them to charge)
Seems kinda shady to me. He's supposed to email me again tomorrow about the car, I'm going to stick to my guns...either give me the price you quoted me and include this ""bogus"" fee in the price of $29,200 or just keep the car.
He also mentioned that the ""Competitive Rebate"" that is available in my region only applies to GM vehicles, NOT to other makes/models. I researched Ford's website and they mention nothing about the car only needing to be a GM product. I'm not trusting these people right now...
I live in Wisconsin, only drive stick shift cars and I'm willing to drive out there to get the car BUT if the pricing isn't good (and right now the dealership looks mighty shady) I'm gonna pass on it. A dealership in my area has the exact car with the exact same options as the model out in Connecticut, but its an AUTOMATIC
Anybody have any dealings with Columbia Ford or any dealings buying a car in Connecticut before? The car is exactly what I want down to the options...but Im not just going to give away $500 just for the hell of it.
Considering the manual transmission is dead for 2015, I'm not paying anymore than the $24500-25500 total for the car. I'm not going to budge a bit!
Thanks in advance for any advice you can give."

Just read your post . Under no circumstance do you drive out of state to buy a vehicle without a signed buyers order. This can be done by fax. You need something in writing from the Int. sales mgr. If a dealer wont due this for you tell them you will take your business elsewhere.

I live in CT, but have never had any dealings with this dealer, nor do I even know where Columbia, CT is. What I can tell you about conveyance fees is that they are real. The dealer has to charge it to everyone. Which just means they have to ""show"" it on the bill of sale. So like so many on edmunds have said before, go in with an ""out the door offer."" They have to sell YOU a car. It does them no good sitting on their lot. Just tell them to take an extra $498 off the price of the car.
Now on the flip side. If you have your heart set on this ""rare bird,"" and you have to have a stick shift, what is an extra $500 in the long run? Or if its the best deal you can get on the car you want, in a year you won't miss it. Either way, keep us in the loop & good luck!"

I can really appreciate your situation, since no one likes to feel like they are getting ripped off. Especially on a bogus fee; but if you try to nail them to the cross on price, they WILL try to make it up at every opportunity. The dealer ""conveyance"" fee is called ""doc prep"" here, and is generally $250 to $300, so $500 is high. They are trying to make sure they can pay the people who work in the back office that you usually do not see from this type of fee. Just to give you background, I worked for GMAC and AmeriCredit as a contract buyer. If you get a good price, and you can negotiate that fee down to $250, then I would sign for it. If you are unwilling to pay it, then they are going to make it up somewhere in F&I on interest or points, or GAP insurance, credit insurance, and so forth."

Just for fun I did an inventory search locally and not one new Fusion in inventory around here has a manual transmission. They all have black interiors too which perhaps says more about how dealers order cars for stock than anything else.
I don't know what advice to give you except to suggest that maybe you could find a local dealer that is willing to do a national inventory search for a car and do a trade with another dealer that might have one of these? Might be less painful in the end than driving all the way to CT."
[Deleted User],Aug-14,"More bad news on the 2015 Sonata/Optima too. The 2015 Sport turbo was tested by C/D (9/14 issue page 77).
It took 8 seconds to get to 60. Just to be clear, the 2015 Sonata/Optima turbo models have been fitted with smaller turbos and have been reduced from 274 horsepower to 245. Still, even with ""just"" 245hp, a 0 to 60 time of 8 seconds is slow. My 2.4 liter non-turbo car is marginally faster to 60 (7.7 seconds).
The 2011-14 ""Sonoptima"" turbo models did 60 in 6.3 seconds. Unfortunately, they were also not able to get anywhere near 24/34 EPA numbers. Hyundai also said the smaller turbos will have ""better tractability"" as well. Scary. To me, it means the turbo models had much worse MPG than advertised, and will be needing a lot of dealer visits as they age.
The non-turbo cars have been reduced to 185hp, down from 200. I believe that this is done for EPA reasons is well.
I gotta tell you, this is the first time I have ever seen a manufacturer reduce it's power figures so dramatically on an essentially unchanged drivetrain. I guess they are trying to avoid being caught in any more lies. Anyway, I feel more happy that I bought the non-turbo as time passes. My Optima is still problem free at 31k, knock on wood!"
m6user,Aug-14,"@cski‌
Before condemning completely based on one source, you might want to consider other sources
from automobilemag.com
""This 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine with its twin-scroll turbocharger has been revised for much improved response at low rpm, so the car surges away from a stoplight with more authority than before. The price has been a reduction in peak output to 245 hp @ 6000 rpm and 260 lb-ft of torque at 1350 – 4000 rpm, some 29 hp and 9 lb-ft less than before.
This seems like a bad deal on paper, yet we liked this 2.0T engine’s notably quicker, quieter response while accelerating away from stoplights in metro driving, and the engine made great use of the 2.0T’s six-speed automatic with its shift paddles on the steering wheel and a set up of shorter ratios in first through fourth gears for quicker acceleration. Also we expect that the 2.0T should more easily make its EPA fuel economy rating of 23 mpg city/32 mpg highway and 26 mpg combined. Even better, the 2.0T comes with a different electric-assisted power steering (the motor is mounted on the steering rack instead of the column), and its behavior feels more natural.""
I'm not really a big fan of Hyundai products(just don't feel they've made it yet in the suspension/handling dept) but I find that 8 sec 0-60 time suspect. Most magazines est. the standard engine 0-60 at about 7.6-7.8. Hard to believe with that much more torque offered at very low rpms it would be would be slower. Maybe it was a ""slow"" day at Car & Driver so to speak."
backy,Aug-14,"I don't think the HP reductions were made to only improve EPA FE ratings. I think they were made for improved driveability. But if 8 secs is all the better the new 2.0T can do, then I bet Hyundai won't sell too many of those. It's plenty fast for me, but it won't compete with the cars that offer a V6. But 185 hp is competitive with base engines in competitors.
I'll be interested to see how the 1.6T does in this car, with ~300 lbs less weight than the 2.0T."

I don't have time to read more than one car mag, but would really like to know if Motortrend, Automobile, etc have different stats."

When you make statements such as:

Did the article actually state that they expect the MPG numbers to be much worse then advertised or that they actually experienced it? Did the article say they expect maint problems with the turbo which would mean more ""dealer visits""? I took it that those were your assumptions. If not, I stand corrected.

I don't think I've seen many 0-60 times per se but the automobilemag article did say they felt the new turbo was faster off the line which makes me think that it would be as fast or faster to 60 than before.

ab348,Aug-14,"Well, those Korean ponies have proven to be a lot smaller and less powerful than their SAE counterparts...
Actually I visited a Hyundai dealer that was closed yesterday and they had the new models parked next to the outgoing version, so it was easy to do a side by side comparison. The new car is much more conservative in design both inside and out. Seeing them in the flesh side by side, I actually like the new design better than the old, with its tortured sheetmetal and overdone styling features. The new car looks bigger, squarer, and a bit more imposing. On the interior it is a similar story. Again the new design is more conservative but in some ways I like it better than the outgoing one, which is very reminiscent to that in many competing cars like the Fusion and Altima. But the ones I saw on the lot had a smaller center screen in the new model than in the old, but that might be a function of trim level, I don't know. The new car had a dash that looked more square and upright than the laid-back version in the old model.
I imagine Hyundai will do what they always do, put enough incentives/cash on the hood to move the metal regardless of how buyers react to the design."

Le t me clear up this statement. I was speaking of the 2011-2014 models. The turbo was swapped out for 2015 and the EPA figures STILL dropped from 24/34 to 23/32. So how close to EPA figures do you think the previous car was able to achieve? Not close at all.
See, I also post on Optima forums site, and get a lot of information from actual owners. They complain of inability to reach EPA figures constantly and in large numbers. Also, higher mileage turbo owners are having trouble with exhaust leaks, turbo bearing failure, and check engine lights resulting in turbocharger replacement."
m6user,Aug-14,"Ok. But didn't everybody know and Hyundai admitted their ""mistakes"" with their MPG? Since I haven't read anything in the auto press about any kind of widespread turbo failures, I wondered about that. Lots of turbos being used now and we haven't heard about a lot of problems."
[Deleted User],Aug-14,"Hey Nova Scotia! (ab348).
One of the first things I checked on my car is if my 2.4 was SAE certified at 200hp and 186 lb ft.
It is SAE certified. I had concerns too, and all I came up with is that the 6 speed is geared for economy, not power. I really have to get some revs before she feels strong. On the highway, 50 to 90 mph is much more impressive than off the line.
The center stack looks very BMW like. The whole design is much more traditional. I have said in the past that I never had to consult the manual on any of the buttons on my car, so it is nice to see that Hyundai is doing the same on the Sonata. The 2.0T Sport in this months C/D has a nice sized screen (looks like 6"" to 7"") and it is built into the dash instead of a pop up unit, which I like better looks wise.
C/D said ""The interior is nicely thought out. There are no glaring ergonomic flaws., and the materials are par for this highly competitive class"". The Sonata registers 7 series quiet on the decibel meter"".
Nuff said!"
dudleyr,Aug-14,"Don't know what the deal is with the Hyundai turbo. Accord and Mazda6 both hit 60 in under 7 seconds (with the stick) and get much better mpg to boot - no turbo needed. Now what exactly is the advantage of the turbo? Ford is in the same boat. CR gets the V-6 Accord at 39 mpg highway and the little turbo 1.5 liter Fusion at 34 mpg, and the Fusion is much much slower. Again - what is the point of the turbo if a V-6 gets better mpg.
Not everybody goofs up the turbo. BMW does well with the 3 series being seriously fast and getting good mpg. The 1.4 liter Fiat/Chrysler turbo also seems to do pretty well.
Until I see real world numbers for turbos these days I take any claims with a grain of salt."

brian125,Aug-14,"cski,
Sounds like the dealer will be checking these things to determine your problem. its always nice to have this done under warranty in the worse case scenario I listed below.
Compressor Checks
Start with the compressor. Does it engage when you turn on the A/C?
If so, the compressor is working and the A/C system probably contains enough refrigerant to make cold air, so the problem is inside the HVAC unit. Replace the motor that controls the blend air door (this is a difficult job and best left to a professional since it involves tearing apart the HVAC unit -- about an 8 to 10 hour job!).
If the compressor does not engage when you turn on the A/C, see if it will run by jumping the compressor clutch wire directly to the battery (use a fused jumper wire). If the compressor works when you jump it, and the A/C blows cold air, the system contains refrigerant and the fault is likely a bad A/C compressor clutch relay or a bad clutch cycling switch or pressure switch.
If the compressor does not engage when you jump it, the problem is a bad compressor clutch.
If the clutch engages but the compressor does not turn (the belt will start to slip and squeal), the compressor is locked up and you need a new compressor.
If the compressor clutch engages and turns the compressor, but the A/C still does not blow cold air, the system is probably low on refrigerant and needs to be recharged."
akirby,Aug-14,If you're getting cold air through some vents and not the others it could be the blend door or the controller controlling the blend door.
brian125,Aug-14,This could be a great excuse to buy a new 2015 Mazda6. I'm sure the Mrs. will understand. Tell her the kids need there air. And the a/c unit blew the motor in the Kia.
[Deleted User],Aug-14,"She isn't that stupid! I think Kirby is on to something though. Still getting cool air from the passenger side, but warm on mine. I think whatever makes it ""dual zone"" is broken.
I am glad it is under warranty. The compressor and everything else is working fine. I washed it today and heard the compressor kick on, and I would have noticed a new sound coming from the engine bay, sounds like ""oh my god what is that?"". Seriously though, I have lucked out since the weather here has been unseasonably cool the entire summer. It was 58 degrees this morning and 57 yesterday. High temperature? 82!! It should be a sticky 82 at 6AM and 99 all day.
I am not complaining though, as I hate the heat; and rolling down the windows has been totally fine except when the sun is directly on the car and I am sitting in traffic... then I feel a bit like a chicken in the oven.
My appointment is tomorrow at 2PM, so I will let you guys know how competent or otherwise the dealer is at sorting this issue."
[Deleted User],Aug-14,"Hey brian125,
I appreciate your troubleshooting advice. I have some down time today and I finally read everyone's post inn detail.
The compressor kicks oink and sounds normal. There is cool air on the passenger side only like I said. Unfortunately I am not me3chanically inclined so I can't diagnose it, but I do have a very long warranty and also bought an additional 5 years and 40k bump 2 bump warranty.
I am fortunate that a loaner car is available on major warranty repairs so maybe I can drive something sweet until they figure out my A/C system.
I have to also say that I use the heck out of the climate control so maybe that is why it ran low early."

Whats a man to do? Walk? I am sure not driving HER car! Lol.
Anyway: A/C problem: Refrigerant was down to 11 pounds, which is half of the 20 pounds it is supposed to be. He evacuated the remaining refrigerant and recharged the system, adding dye in case it has a slow leak. I am not sure if A/C naturally burns up it's refrigerant or not, but I read that burning 1 to 2 pounds a year is common.
I am certain though that it is a slow leak. When I drove home I was frozen after 5 mins! It was even very cold while sitting in traffic, whereas before it barely stayed cool unless I was on the highway. So, slow in fact that I didn't notice it until a few weeks ago, and even then blamed it on the car sitting in the sun and just taking time to cool down.
I am happy with what Fairfax Kia did, and it was so nice outside that I ended up talkin' cars with the staff in the outside waiting area. If someone had brought a grill and some beer it would have been a cookout."

So, instead of being smart and playing that card later, I cashed in and made out with his girlfriend right there on the spot.
She has never let me forget it. Ever. Now every time there is a pretty girl at a party or get together she hits me with ""Do you wanna make out with her too?"""
m6user,Aug-14,I just recharged the a/c on my Tundra last year. It is a 2003. It still had about half so that system didn't leak much over 11 years. I did it myself with a kit and it was very simple. Took about 15 minutes. Our 2007 Mazda still blows cold. I would guess a leak versus normal slippage.
[Deleted User],Aug-14,"So do any of you see the resemblance between the new Subaru Legacy and the new Sonata? Pay special attention to the grill and the taillight where it tapers into the rear quarter panel. (side view).
Thanks for all the advice on my A/C problem. Everyone was cool and supportive. I agree that it is a leak, and the mechanic suspects one too, so they put dye in the system so that if it is leaking they can find it quickly and fix it permanently.
As far as the visit was concerned, they took my car in promptly on time, and had it fixed and ready to go in an hour and a half. That included 30 mins of running the A/C and looking for leaks, then checked the Freon level again and founds none missing. I sat in the outside waiting area with customers and Kia employees that were out for a smoke, and we talked cars, and enjoyed the perfect 80 degree weather with NO humidity,.
This mechanic was about my age, and he was really knowledgeable and genuinely friendly. Nice guy.
Overall I was very pleased."
[Deleted User],Aug-14,I have seen the kit advertised on TV. It's like $79 I have a question though. Did you have to evacuate the system before pumping in the new refrigerant?
backy,Aug-14,"Yes, there's a similarity in the grille, but that shape of grill is becoming pretty common (e.g. Ford Taurus). But Hyundai started using that shape of grille on new vehicles some time ago, with the 2013+ Santa Fe.
As for tail lamps, I don't see a big similarity other than both cars use teardrop-style lamps. But Hyundai used somewhat similar lamps on the 2011-14 Sonata. And this general style of tail lamp is very common these days, e.g. Fusion, Forte, Camry..."
m6user,Aug-14,"@‌ cski
The kit was about $49 @ Wal-Mart. No evac. Just hook up, turn on, watch gauge and shut off at right pressure. Ice cold ever since. Prob have about half a bottle of the stuff left to top if it leaks a little over time. I watched a couple of you-tube vids to make sure it was as easy as it looked. It was."
[Deleted User],Aug-14,". > @backy said:

Exactly. The tail-lamplights are common these days, but it is because of the Sonata's success that it is copied by many manufacturers. Keep in mind the cars coming out today were penned 4 years ago. It takes that long to engineer an all new model, get it built, and delivered to the customer. The 2011 Sonata was the first mid size to be stylish beyond it's price point. It was a finalist for Motor-Trend COY, a C/D top 10 pick, was the International COY, the 2011 Consumer Guide Best Buy and the Canadian COY. Unbelievably, it was a 2011 top safety pick too, and was advertised as having 24/35 MPG. There are ten more lesser known awards on the Sonata wiki page.
The point is that the new Legacy looks a heck of a lot like the 2015 Sonata to me. In profile, from the back, and the front. I don't think it was by mistake.
I remember a time when I made fun of Sonata's. So-not-a-car is one of the terms my wife and I used on Hyundai's initial effort with the nameplate. Now there is one in my driveway. Guess who's laughing now?"
mtnman1,Aug-14,"I noticed that as well the second I saw the new Subaru, but I think the Sonata is better looking. I thought last year's Subaru was much better looking than this year. In fact I was disappointed they changed the Legacy. I was going to be considering one in 2015 or 2016 when I replace my Fusion. Now it looks like I will definitely be interested in the Sonata. It seems to me that when Ford came out with the Taurus back many years ago many brands copied that style as well."
[Deleted User],Aug-14,"Man, I don't know which one is a better car, although AWD is a bonus... but not with only 175 hp. Yes it's class competitive but the AWD it adds weight you have to drag around when your not using it.
Anyway, I still think the Mazda 6 and the Accord would be my two choices at this point. It's a shame they were not available when I was buying. I also have to admit a $399/month on a 335i sounds good too, (lease) except a BMW is actually a car I would rather keep. Decisions decisions!"
benjaminh,Aug-14,"For 2015, the Honda Accord now is rated 31 mpg overall by the EPA. That's up one mpg from last year (new transmission software?). Anyway, for overall epa mpg here's how it stacks up right now in midsize for the standard entry-level model with auto trans:
31 mpg
Accord, Altima
30 mpg
Mazda6
29
Sonata, Malibu
28
Camry, Passat, 200
27
Optima
26
Fusion"
benjaminh,Aug-14,"Those differences might seem bigger than they are. For instance, if you drive 15k miles a year, the EPA estimates the gas costs for an Accord at $1700, while a Fusion comes in at $2000. A $300 dollar difference isn't really all that much, but over a decade it comes to 3 grand, which begins to look like a lot of meals out...."
akirby,Aug-14,The fusion 1.5L turbo is 28 not 26. 26 is the 2.0L turbo.
explorerx4,Aug-14,The 2.5 is the base engine in the Fusion. Not sure what the take rate is on them. Pretty much every Fusion I see has an Ecoboost or Hybrid badge.
[Deleted User],Aug-14,"Benjaminh:
I have to admit that a Hybrid is the clear choice here in congested land. I would have saved a ton of dough in fuel. As all of you know my 12 Optima averages only 20mpg in this environment. Out on the super-slab I have observed 30.6 mpg on my way from DC to Myrtle Beach, so it is capable of it's EPA figures, just not here where there are 5 stoplights between my house and the grocery store.
In more progressive, liberal areas like Los Angeles many people have gone one step further; ditching internal combustion. altogether and switched to E/V's. I read there are 49 electric vehicle chargers in Century City CA. That is only 176 acres.
To find out how many EV chargers are available in your area just go to www.chargepoint.com and enter your location. In my county there are 17 chargers, but 7 of them are on car dealership back lots. The closest, free EV charger is 6 miles away from my house. There are 5 gas stations within one mile. The Tesla model S is the ""halo car"" of EV range, with a 200 mile capability if you are very, very careful with the right foot. The entrance on the Tesla is steep though, at $100,000. You can drive Tesla technology for less however. All you need is $42k to step into a Mercedes B class crossover, powered by Tesla drivetrain.
I can't wait to see what technology pans out in the next 20 to 30 years. With cars like the BMW i8 out on they frontier of what is possible, it looks like a progression of hybrid technology that will continue to shrink down the on board internal combustion engine as a range life-line until better battery technology allows it is no longer needed."
benjaminh,Aug-14,"My 2008 Accord is rated by the epa at 25 overall, but since I mostly do city driving with it I probably get closer to 23 or so.
If, for my next car, I got an Accord Hybrid (epa city 50) I'd save as much as $1000 a year on gas. Won't pay for the car, but that adds up...."
suydam,Aug-14,"My 2013 regular Accord gets 28 around town, 37-40 on highway depending on how long the trip is. I always use the Eco button. Huge difference from the Maxima it replaced. If we move to Calif. I would definitely consider the Leaf as a second car."
benjaminh,Aug-14,"Yeah, our 2013 Accord gets c. 20% higher mpg than the 2008. On recent hwy trips to move our son to college (sigh) we got c. 36-38 mpg with the AC on. That compares to about 30 on a similar trip with the 2008. The next all-new Accord is due in the Fall of 2017 for the 2018 model years. Wonder how much that will go up. Can they get another 20%? Probably not. I've heard that like Ford Honda plans to go almost all turbo, which seems like a mistake. The added cost and complexity don't seem worth it for the small real world gains in mpg.
Consumer Reports a while back had a surprisingly snarky column where they called Ford's engines ""Eco-Boast"" because the real world mpg didn't live up to the advertised figures...."
backy,Aug-14,"I know you said ""standard entry-level model"", but if you look at gas-powered (non-hybrid) models, another worthy contender in the FE race is the Sonata Eco, rated at 32 mpg overall with the 1.6T and 7-speed tranny. I think its list price is pretty close to that of the base Accord (for example). Of course, most mid-sized cars don't offer a smaller-displacement turbo option--the Fusion does, and I believe VW is planning to offer a smaller-than-1.8T option on the Passat but not sure about that. And of course looking at all non-hybrid models, the Passat offers the TDI with excellent FE."
ryster,Aug-14,"The 200 mile range Tesla S 60 starts at $69,900. The mid-level ""85"" that provides 265 miles of range starts at $79,900. The P85, which is the performance model, starts at $93,400. There is $7,500 tax credit which is not included in the prices. That means if you want a Tesla S, and only need 200 miles of range and can settle for a 0-60 of 5.9s, you could get into one somewhere around $63,000. There is a 3 month wait, but people who want one will wait. More and more of them are showing up on the roads around here."
benjaminh,Aug-14,"For 2015 lowest-priced midsize sedan in America is, amazingly enough, not a Hyundai or Kia, but the Mazda 6, which starts at just $21,190 for the 6-speed manual transmission model. And to most people (me included) the 6 is probably the best-looking midsize car made right now. Comes with Mazda's award-winning Skyactiv tech with an overall epa rating of 29, which beats the manual Accord by 2, since the manual Accord gets 27. The base Mazda6 also has all the standard stuff (cruise, AC, etc.) plus standard 17"" alloy wheels. And the 6 gets a Top Safety Pick + from the IIHS:
http://www.iihs.org/iihs/ratings/vehicle/v/mazda/6/2014
I've owned or had extensive experience with three different Mazdas over almost 30 years, and they were all excellent cars in terms of reliability, quality, performance, and in terms of their fun-to-drive factor. Excellent manual transmissions on all Mazdas. Very smooth. In a very competitive segment, this is one of many excellent cars to choose from. And even though the all-new 6 has been a hit, they still don't sell nearly as many as the other midsize cars, and so you arguably feel a little more special because you're driving something that you won't see at every stoplight.
So: the Mazda6 has the lowest msrp, but has the highest mpg of any midsize manual, and arguably the best styling. Finally, in most professional test that I've seen, the Mazda6 is also said to have the best handling and the highest ""fun-to-drive"" factor."
backy,Aug-14,"Wrong. The 2015 Sonata SE starts at $21,150 with a 6-speed automatic. Including the unavoidable destination charge, the Mazda6 Sport MT is $21,985 with no options, and the Sonata SE is $21,960. With an AT, the Mazda6 Sport starts at $23,690 including destination. FWIW, the Sonata Eco with 7AT and the equivalent of the SE's PEP ($1,200 on the SE) and 32 mpg EPA overall is only $24,085, or only $395 more than the base Mazda6 with an AT and much less equipment than the Eco."
benjaminh,Aug-14,Thanks for the correction!++
[Deleted User],Aug-14,"I am not even going to try to talk numbers with you... ever. LOL.
I would have a difficult time choosing between the Accord and the 6. Very difficult. I have seen the Accord everywhere, and in huge numbers. It looks like a 15 to 1 ratio so you are right there. I think that Mazda is very rigid on it's prices, and that is part of the reason there aren't as many. Mazda is trying to elevate the brand as offering a higher quality product. I would have a very hard time paying sticker for anything so I am not sure which car I would come home with."
benjaminh,Aug-14,"The 2015 Sonata is a pretty impressive package for the price. Even the base model has some stuff not found on any of the other base models as far as I know, like heated mirrors, LED daytime running lights, and XM radio. Plus it has the longest warranty (along with KIA) of any midsize car. Another strong choice."
benjaminh,Aug-14,"backy: You seem to have the facts at your fingertips better than I do. Any chance you'd be willing to give us the mrsps of some of the other midsize cars for 2015? If not, that's fine."
benjaminh,Aug-14,"The other best-looking midsize car, in addition to the Mazda6, is the Ford Fusion. Although I'd really say it's a 3-way tie, because the current Optima has aged very well, and even after 4 years looks great imho. I have to admit my Accord is second place in looks to all of those cars.
At the risk of being wrong, I'm going to say (looking at Ford's page that's right in front of me) that the base Fusion starts at $22,400. That's with the 2.5 engine. Is that engine quieter now? Last time I drove a Ford 2.5, which was about c. 2010 in a rental Fusion of the last generation, it was rather noisy."
suydam,Aug-14,For me the Accord is in first place in looks-- the driver's looks. It has the best visibility by far.
benjaminh,Aug-14,"Yes, I agree with that! And although the Accord's looks are more restrained than the Mazda6, Fusion, or Optima, in a form-follows-function way I think the current Accord is a very nice looking design that will age well.
I saw a c. 20-year old Accord on the road today, and it still looked good to my eyes, which is not something I can say about most other midsize cars from the 1990s. Honda doesn't always succeed, but I think they aim for elegant designs that will stand the test of time."
[Deleted User],Aug-14,"I agree. There is a 1993 in my neighborhood with the nice gold color and the silver-platter wheels that still looks fresh and modern to my eyes as well. I think the current generation looks like a super-sized version. I think the best way to describe both is tasteful and enduring.
Lastly, I would really like better visibility as well. I am tired of wrenching my neck and worrying that I might have missed someone behind me. Since all vehicles under 10,000 pounds are required to have them by 2018 in the US it is probably a safe bet that we all will have them eventually. It is expected that 70% will have them well before that date however due to customer expectations."
benjaminh,Aug-14,"Poor rear visibility is the current plague of midsize cars designs imho.
The best visibility, as all the professional reviewers who mention it seem to say, is the Accord by far.
Good-enough second place visibility is found in the Mazda6, Camry, and maybe another one I'm forgetting.
Most of the rest have poor rear visibility, with the worst perhaps being cski's awesome-looking but imho not entirely thought-out Optima.
Side cameras, like I have on my Accord, do help, but nothing beats being able to look all around you. Hope Honda bucks the trend and keeps it up, but it seems like they are swimming against a powerful styling tide. The plus side of that, maybe, is that it almost makes the Accord stand out at this point? Not sure...."
suydam,Aug-14,Another midsizer with good visibility is the Nissan Altima. Also a nice looking car on the outside too.
benjaminh,Aug-14,"Are you sure? Have you been in one of the new ones? It looks to me like the small rear window behind the driver, like the small rear window on the Passat, Fusion, and others, is not really very functional from the driver's point of view.
I had that kind of window on my 2000 Ford Focus, and it seemed like a cruel trick. From the outside it seemed like you'd be able to see out of it. And you can—from the back seat. But from the driver's POV you might as well put masking tape over the small rear window's glass for all the good it's going to do you. Those kinds of rear quarter windows are just not really that functional....
The Hofmeister kink, as you know, is almost part of my religion when it comes to car design.
Best visibility in any sedan by far? Beating even the Accord?
BMW's 3-series. BMW, of course, was where Wilhelm Hofmeister got his kinks out originally back in c. 1960."
suydam,Aug-14,We drove a '13 when we were shopping. It had great visibility. Most reviews mention it too. We chose the Accord for other reasons.
backy,Aug-14,"All I did is google ""2015 car_model_here msrp"" and the base msrp for that car came up in the first few hits. On the Sonata and Mazda6, I also went to their respective manufacturer web sites to ""build it now"" to make sure I had the correct pricing including destination.
One thing I noticed... if you want a red Mazda6, it'll cost you an extra $300. Which is too bad as that's my favorite color. But lots of automakers charge extra for certain paint colors."
benjaminh,Aug-14,"That Mazda6 red is hot. On the Mazda web site it says: ""No Shade of Red was good enough. So we engineered a new one with an elaborate three-step painting process. The result is a red so deep yet so vibrant, it could only be called Soul Red.""
Probably worth $300.
But charging extra for colors, which is something BMW does, seems a little tricky? But it probably does reflect some real extra costs."
benjaminh,Aug-14,"The 2015 Passat 5-speed manual is also about $22k flat with destination, making it along with the Sonata and Mazda6 one of the lowest priced midsize cars in America.
This car is too often overlooked imho, esp. now that it has a 1.8 liter turbo as standard. I fear to get my facts wrong again, but I think this is the only standard turbo engine in the midsize segment. Other nice features include standard integrated side mirror turn signal lights, biggest rear legroom in the class, rear passenger ventilation in center console, cool-looking analog clock, 60/40 folding rear seat.
The Passat also has one of the smaller turning circles in the class, at 36.4 feet. At 15.9 feet it may also have the largest trunk in the class.
Finally, it's built at VW's state of the art factory in TN.
It's a heck of a lot of car for the money. They also throw in free maintenance for the first two years.
The styling is clean and functional. I actually like it quite a lot.
Handling is also supposed to be close to best-in-class.
Real mystery as to why this one isn't selling like hotcakes."
backy,Aug-14,"Yes, you found the winner! The 2015 Passat S with a stick is $20 less (including destination) than the 2015 Sonata SE with automatic.
The Passat may be the only mid-sized family car with a standard turbo. But it also may have the least power of any standard engine in the class, 170 hp.
I agree the Passat is a lot of car for the money. But so are cars like the Sonata, Optima, Accord, and Mazda6. I think there may be 2 reasons the Passat isn't selling like hotcakes: the perception that VW still has a quality problem, and the hum-drum styling of the current Passat. Maybe when the next Passat arrives, with swoopier styling, it will sell better.
Case in point: you like the Passat a lot, but what did you buy?"
benjaminh,Aug-14,"So it's the Passat manual that's the lowest-priced midsize car in America? At most dealers, however, they probably don't even stock the base manual model. My local dealers don't seem to anyway.
But one local VW dealer has been offering 3-4k off of the last of the 2014 Passats some with an msrp of c. 24k.
Having been burned by a VW long ago, and having read quite a few more concerning stories online even in the last 10 years, I'm afraid I'm not likely to ever buy a VW. Plus, as you know, I'm a big Honda fan.
Your thoughts as to why sales haven't taken off seem on target. This generation of Passat is actually selling much better than the last generation, but given that they have a capacity in TN make 70,000 year more that the market just doesn't seem to want to buy, it has been a letdown for VW.
The biggest weakness of the car a year or so ago was the loud, weak, and gas guzzling standard 5 cylinder engine. And so now that they've gone to the 1.8 turbo that accelerates to 60 a full second faster, and gets c. 3 more mpg, sales might improve.
VW does have another class-exclusive, as far as I know, but it's not something that you can see very well from the surface. The Passat is put together with what's called ""laser seam welding,"" which is supposed to be stronger and higher quality than the spot welding used by everyone else. Here's a little video about it:
So there are a lot of class-exclusive features with the Passat. Here's a strong road test review by ""Drivin' Ivan"":"
backy,Aug-14,"Well, that's the thing, isn't it? I don't know about Mazda6 Sport sticks, but it's not hard to find a base Sonata on dealer lots (although a lot of them seem to have the PEP). At least Mazda (and VW and Honda) _offer _their mid-sized sedans with a stick.
$3-4k off of a 2014 isn't anything special. I routinely see $5k+ off 2014s like the Sonata, Fusion, Optima, and Camry. Recently I saw those cars as low as $16.5k (Fusion S) to $17k (Optima LX, Sonata GLS). I never see discounts off list for Hondas because my area dealers never advertise price, just lease rates. :@ But from reports here, you can get a big discount on 2014 Accords too."
benjaminh,Aug-14,"16.5 for a Fusion!!? What a steal. Amazing. Or 17k for an Optima. Prices aren't as low here in Louisville, but I did see a few months ago things like 18.9 for a Sonata, Camry, or Altima.
Honda actively discourages dealers from advertising on price. In fact, I think they have an almost iron-clad rule against it. Not sure how they make that stick, but, they seem to be able to. Honda's idea is that they are trying to sell on quality, engineering excellence, and ""value."" Seems to sort-of work, but given that others are taking 5k or more off of the list price they've lost a little bit of market share in 2014. That loss of market share has mainly been the collapse of their Acura car line up. They had to delay the new TLX several months to fix quality issues, but in the meantime dealers pretty much ran out of the outdated TL and TSX cars that it's replacing, and so Acura dealers until the last week or so haven't really had many cars to sell.
Anyway, in terms of midsize you can get $3k off an Accord, plus 0.9% financing for five years. But when others are offering $5k off plus 0%, it's sometimes tough to make a sale. As a Honda fan, I do think an Accord is a better car than some competitors and worth paying more for, but for some people a Camry is just as good, and so if that's cheaper...
Anyway, the new TLX, plus the new small Honda SUV called, I think, the HRV, should boost Honda's market share a little for calendar year 2015."

Over in the ""Accord Prices Paid"" discussion, folks are routinely getting $1000-2000 below invoice for their Accords.
I haven't bought an Accord in 20 years; when I did, it was based on a specific advertised price in the LA Times - I want to say something like $13,xxx against an MSRP of $16,500 or so. 1993 LX Automatic (""One only at this price!"")."
explorerx4,Aug-14,"Here is the review of the Fusion. One mistake I noticed was he said it had a 2.5 liter ecoboost engine. My wife's Escape has the quad fuel display, which I wish my Fusion had.
https://youtube.com/watch?v=aF3dHTzXKp0"
robr2,Aug-14,"Except that the ""free maintenance"" is about 2 oil changes and will be going to 12 months/12,000 miles which is one oil change worth about $65.
When they went to the ""free maintenance"" they also dropped the warranty from 4/50 to 3/36."
[Deleted User],Aug-14,"Oh yeah. Kia will negotiate big-time. There was a 2014 LX on one of those raised platforms with $18,500 on the window among balloons and other such frippery. They also quoted me $26k on a 2014 SX, and that was before I really pressed and did some research.
Also Backy, most of those prices you are seeing are after ALL POSSIBLE DISCOUNTS. Not many qualify for all of them."
[Deleted User],Aug-14,"That's because ""Spicy Red"" was already taken by my car.
On the Passat after viewing the review: For ""just under $32,000"" I can get lots of cars with lots more power. There has to be a way to get the 2.0T for similar money. It is almost a sin to not buy the 2.0T or the TDI. 170 hp in a large car is just barely adequate. My car has 30 more HP, and similar MPG numbers when on the highway and in less congested suburbs. Lastly, my warranty is vastly longer and parts/repairs promise to be a lot cheaper after the warranty period. I wont have to worry about that however because I will be done with the car at 100k anyway."
benjaminh,Aug-14,"Do most midsize cars have active sites for fans of the car? I honestly don't know. For Accord fans there's driveaccord.net and vtec.net, and probably some others I don't know about. Is there a fan site for the Sonata, for instance, as well as for the Fusion?"
Michaell,Aug-14,"Maybe not the Sonata specifically, but there are a number of Hyundai sites (and forums) that I found after getting my E-GT."
benjaminh,Aug-14,"The lowest-priced Accord for 2015 is the LX 6-speed manual, which has an msrp of $22,105 before destination. Destination adds 800 or so, but since all of these cars, as we've said, can be had for 3k-4k off msrp, it seems ok to me to start with the predestination price. If you actually do get at least 3k-4k off, but then add taxes and fees, you might even end back up at roughly the msrp without dest price when all is said and done.
Anyway, compared that way, a new Passat 5-speed manual lists for $21,120. On the surface of it, you might wonder how Honda can charge 1k more for the comparable car. Are they charging for the Honda badge? Maybe a little. And also for Honda reliability, which most would agree is still better than VW's reliability at this point. But there are a few other things as well.
First, of course, Honda gives you a 6-speed manual rather than VW's somewhat old-fashioned at this point 5-speed. Just a few years ago 6-speed manuals were only available on fancy cars like Acuras and BMWs. Anyway, that's probably worth a few hundred bucks right there, and probably costs Honda at least that much compared to VW's 5-speed. Just making up something, let's say that's worth $300.
Second, the Accord has a very useful standard back-up camera. Honda pioneered making this standard back in the Fall of 2012. They even do it for the civic. But everyone else seems to charge extra for this, or make you go to a higher trim level, including VW. This is worth at least several hundred dollars imho—maybe $500.
Third, even the Accord LX has some nice alloy wheels, while I think the bottom-of-the line Passat has plastic wheel covers. To me, avoiding that cheap look is worth at least $100 a wheel for another $400.
The LX Accord also throws in a few other things standard the base Passat doesn't have, like floor mats ($100?), seat back pockets ($100), illuminated vanity mirrors ($200), trunk light ($50?), dual zone climate control (Passat has single zone climate control--$300?), and hill start assist for the clutch ($200).
Add all that up, and it doesn't seem like Honda is charging for the badge.
But the Passat does have a few things the Accord doesn't have, like a split folding rear seat ($300?), side mirror turn-signal indicators ($200), and two more speakers for the standard stereo ($200), and....that's all I can find at the moment.
Bottom line is that the 1k price difference does seem more or less fair."
[Deleted User],Aug-14,"Hey Ben, good question. All three have them and then some:
optima forums .
sonata forums
ford fusion club
altima forums
passat world
mazda 6 forum
camry forums
I don't want to get in trouble with the moderator so you guys will have to use you head to discover how to find the exact addresses.
I don't know about the others, but the Optima site has been very helpful when it comes to resolving very specific questions. For example; I was very concerned about the way my engine sounded at startup right after I bought mine. It sounded like a bucket of rocks, but then went away after a minute or so. I had to know if it was normal or not. My fears were laid to rest after learning my first lesson on how direct injection works, and that the racket was normal."
benjaminh,Aug-14,"Honda must have done something with its DI engine, because our 2013 Accord with the direct injected engine doesn't sound like you're describing. It's maybe slightly louder than the non-DI engine in my 08 Accord, but only very slightly.
But yes, these car specific sites are often very useful. For instance, very early 2013 Accords needed a software update for the CVT, and at driveaccord.net they had the technical service bulletin #s and so on for that."
[Deleted User],Aug-14,Are both the new Acura TSX and TLX based on the Accord?
[Deleted User],Aug-14,"My car makes a clack, clack, clack sound as the high pressure injection system starts to work. Even after I read that it was normal I drove another EX to make sure, and it made the exact same noise. There are hundreds of entries about it on the Optima Forums site, meaning that almost everyone there has asked about it. Just a normal GDI engine at work.
The Accord probably has better insulation....but try listening to the engine with the hood up while another person starts it....I am curious if Honda was able to tune it out somehow.
BTW: I agree with you wholeheartedly on buying the Accord over the frumpy-shoe box looking Passat. I do like the interior on the Passat better on SEL models, but that is about it. It's funny that Honda is now throwing in a lot of accessories, because the opposite used to be true. I remember when the Accord had 4 different inline-4's one on every trim level, all with 10 to 30 HP differences on essentially the same block. The DX and LX usually had an SOHC head for example. So, you had to buy at least the EX or the Si to get maximum fun. Now a days you get almost all the power you need on the LX EX and Sport. We all know the V6 model is very quick...almost as quick as a standard BMW 3 series. A compelling car in every trim level."
benjaminh,Aug-14,"The TSX is being phased out. It was based on the smaller Euro-Accord.
The new TLX is based on the new Accord, but they've spent more than a billion dollars redesigning and upgrading the frame, the engines, the transmissions, the steering, the interior, the standard stuff, etc. And yet the msrp price difference between an Accord EXL and the TLX is less than you might expect.
I'm actually very tempted by the TLX for my next car. Looks like an outstanding value.
When it comes to engines, as you say, Honda used to do what some of the others (like Ford) still do now: give a lower-level engine on the entry model.
When we got our 2008 Accord, for instance, they had one kind of engine for the LX model, and a nicer, quieter, and more powerful (i.e. almost Acura) engine for the EX and above.
I credit KIA and Hyundai for getting rid of that at Honda. KIA and Hyundai gave as standard these advanced DI engines, even on the base model. And so, for 2013, Honda started doing that too.
Btw, I have listened to the Honda DI engine with hood up. It does clatter some, but not a lot. Don't know what Honda did, but it's not as noisy as what you're describing, or what I seem to have heard from other recent DI engines...."
Kirstie_H,Aug-14,"May be a bit tricky, but $300 isn't highway robbery. Honestly, if $300 was all that stood in the way of me having my preferred color, I'd gladly pay it. Over the period of intended ownership, it's not that much, and if I didn't pop for it, I know I'd look at the vehicle every day and think that I liked it, but wished I'd splurged on the color I really wanted."
benjaminh,Aug-14,"2015 Honda Accord EXL msrp: $28,420
2015 Acura TLX base msrp: $30,995
That's a difference in price of about $2600.
If you look at what's standard on the TLX, you get a heck of a lot for that $2600.
Real world pricing, however, means that you're likely to be able to get almost 3k off of a new 2015 Accord right off the bat, while the all-new TLX seems to be going for closer to list for the moment. But in a few months, when Acura ramps up production of the TLX in Ohio....?"
benjaminh,Aug-14,"I agree with you, Kirstie, about the colors. I certainly wouldn't let $300 stand in my way.
But when you look at a new BMW 320i sedan, which is a car I've admired since I was a kid, it starts at $32,750. But when you add things that are standard even on an Accord EXL, or Acura TLX, like the color of your choice ($550), heated seats, back up camera, etc. (all of which are extra on the 320i) you are very soon looking at a car north of $40,000 that has less horsepower than a Honda Accord 4 cylinder...."
dudleyr,Aug-14,"I would not compare a TLX to an Accord. EPA has it at 93 ft3. Less than a Civic or Fit (95,96). The Accord is 103 (little less with the sunroof).
It is about the same size on the outside and weighs more, but they have shrunk the inside considerably."
[Deleted User],Aug-14,"Totally agree Ben..
A recent comparo that included the 320i showed a 0 to 60 time of 6.6 seconds for the BMW, which is exactly the same as the Accord Sport manual observed by C/D in it's 30k long term test. When you compare the two cars, the Accord Sport is $8k cheaper, and also does not include heated seats, SAT radio or GPS. This may represent a more apples to apples comparison at the other end of the price scale.
So even the Accord Sport looks like a better value with similar equipment of the base 320i, but curiously the Accord also limits the colors... to grey and black, and they will not spray it any other color. Bummer, because the blue Accord Sport is my favorite looking Accord by far....a shame it comes only with a CVT...even if Honda's is a good one."
explorerx4,Aug-14,"My mom's Fiesta has paint that was an extra $300. It's worth every penny. It just stands out from the usual clear coat paints and easily cleans up great. Pic was taken with my phone, so not the best."
suydam,Aug-14,Dark red with tan leather looks good. My favorite interior is light or medium grey. I will not have a car with black leather interior. I prefer exteriors that are light but not white -- the medium blue of the Chevy Cruze is one of my favorites and I wish my Accord had been available in that color. Too dark shows every speck. Silver is pretty forgiving and that may be one reason for its popularity too.
benjaminh,Aug-14,"Because of the slightly swoopier styling, and very padded seats, the TLX is smaller inside than the Accord. On the outside it even cuts 1 inch in length. But it's still a midsize imho. And it starts at $31k for the base model. Haven't seen a test of the base model until now, but here it is. And in this video at the 7 minute mark you can hear with the hood up what a Honda/Acura direct-injected engine sounds like. This is almost exactly what my wife's 2013 Accord sounds like. And so it is a bit clattery, but I wouldn't describe it as unrefined (cski: comparison with your engine?):
The reviewer is wrong when saying he thinks it's ""real wood."" Many other reviews have confirmed that it's ""Plood."" But I think it looks nice."
[Deleted User],Aug-14,"Thanks ben. I guess I will discuss my impression of the whole car, since it is mid-size and based on the Accord.
Overview:
I really like the TLX except for the beak grill, and that is just personal preference. I like the interior layout too, with great fit and finish and some nice aluminum touches that I hope are real. My lowly Korean also has real aluminum trim, which could easily be made out of the scrap leftover from the manufacturing process.
DI engine noise: The clacking is exactly the same as mine, but the Acura's is twice as loud and doesn't go away. Weird, since I would think it would be quieter. When the host revs the engine I wanted to strangle him since it didn't take 15 revs for me to get what the exhaust sounded like.
Pet peeve: This car has two very large screens (a 7"" and an 8""), yet has no GPS? [non-permissible content removed]
My car has a hood strut that is exactly where the TLX is, and the engine in this car is exactly the same layout as mine, right down to the intake scoop, battery location, engine position etc.. It has similar power output as well, but the ride and refinement is where the Acura will shine, and where mine just doesn't. There is no comparison in this category.
My Kia has lousy steering and rebound control. The front suspension bottoms out frequently and then the bump reverberates through the chassis like an old school bus. I would tell anyone looking for a midsize to take each car you are comparing home for 24 hours so you get a full impression before you buy. I didn't do that, and paid the price for it."
stickguy,Aug-14,"Well, after watching that review, sounds like I would love it."
ab348,Aug-14,"A local guy drove the TLX last week and posted this. First negative review I've seen. Later on he tried the V6 and liked it much, much better.
""Drove both the 4 cylinder and V6 FWD TLXs today, both mid-level Technology package equipped.
Being Hondas, they are of course idiosyncratic which is not necessarily bad.
Extremely competent salesman, a first in my 2 years of looking for a half-decent new car to replace my 08 Legacy GT. Off to a good start, then.
The 4 cylinder had electronic nannies that could not be entirely shut off, apparently. Tooted at me for an old woman who had actually already crossed the road. Why? Big orange light in dash, BRAKE, as you come to a stop. Groan. Noisy 4 cylinder engine sound, and kind of dull response to a bootful of gas, while the transmission dithered. No torque, just noisy revs.
Then, having to cut across two lanes of traffic to re-enter dealership, from a complete stop with wheels cut over - goosed it to get rolling - nothing. A feeling of a dozen squirrels frantically checking and trying to find a gear, any gear, and a full two second wait while the salesman cringed at oncoming traffic bearing down, before something caught and it moved. Then it upshifted three gears at ten to fifteen mph going up the steep slope to the showroom, lugging the engine down so low in rpm it shuddered. Er, no.
Folks, you can have that model. NOT for me. Dangerous. Not a patch on the LGT in engine note or get up and go. The 20 inch tires they had fitted to impress someone or other were also incredibly noisy, like driving a CLA with 18s - what a tin can that thing is, btw!"""
[Deleted User],Aug-14,"I see the problem....you have to upgrade from the SVT (Squirrel Velocity Trans) to the optional Cheetah Variable Trans. God...everyone knows that!
Seriously though, what does ""not a patch on the LGT in engine note or get up and go"" mean?"
Mr_Shiftright,Aug-14,"GEESH--- I hope that ""redline sound"" at the beginning of the video was merely simulated--revving a car to redline in neutral is risky."
[Deleted User],Aug-14,"Oh no...it was on purpose. When he revved it the first time while viewing the I/P it wasn't too bad, but then he did it over and over again while the camera was trained in the exhaust. I think we all got the gist after one or two revs. I like the car, but I think in order to get the whole TLX experience you need to buy the V6. So, the V6 would put you at $40k. At that price point there is stiff competition. I like the Audi S3 Quattro with the 295 HP 2.0T and a zero to 60 time at an unbelievable 4.4 seconds. A full half second faster than the S4!"
Mr_Shiftright,Aug-14,I'd snatch the keys from his hand if he did that to my car. Those pistons and connecting rods have no load on them. All engines that are ungoverned in that way will rev up to self-destruction levels.
suydam,Aug-14,No keys. Key fob maybe?
explorerx4,Aug-14,"Watching that review of the MercURA TLX, I'm glad I spent my money on my Fusion.
Better looking (duh), cheaper, faster, more room, more tech features, comparable fuel mileage and uses RUG.
TLX engine probably sounds better at high revs, but with a turbo I don't need to work the engine to get speed.
Got oil changed and tires rotated. With $10 rebate about $47. Car was returned to me washed and with the tires dressed."
[Deleted User],Aug-14,At Kia we just get a bucket and hose with some dish detergent. Ahem.
benjaminh,Aug-14,"There are screaming deals out there right now.
I've seen Altimas, Sonatas, and others for 19k for a while, but Honda Accords are available too starting at that price, at least at some places. Wow."
m6user,Aug-14,"Lots of deals for $5k-$6k off MSRP on Camry, Altima, Malibu and others. Many around 17k in Chicago area. Seen some ads for $8k off brand-new 2013s. Heck they are even advertising $3k off the new 2015 Sonata and that just hit dealers recently. Honda only shows lease prices and since in IL one has to pay tax on the entire price of the car up front leasing isn't that popular for average consumers. Mostly business use or luxury car leases."
benjaminh,Aug-14,8k? Wow. But on a 2013. Who has leftover 2013s? What car is that?
Michaell,Aug-14,"Taxation for leases is changing in IL as of 1/1/15 - will only tax the payment each month, not the entire purchase amount."
m6user,Aug-14,Good to know! Only 5 more months. I may consider leasing in the future since I only put about 9k miles a year on my primary vehicle and I could probably get a decent low mileage lease.
[Deleted User],Aug-14,"Survey: If you needed a new mid size and were buying today, Which model would you choose, and why?"
akirby,Aug-14,Fusion. I like Fords to begin with but I love the styling on this one and all the tech features. Drove mine home from the airport late last night after a week away and it was such a pleasure.
suydam,Aug-14,Honda Accord. That's what I bought last year and I wouldn't change it.
backy,Aug-14,"I really don't know, as I haven't driven most of the new designs. I do know that if this car were for me (not my wife), it would most likely come down to the Mazda6 Sport 6MT, Accord LX 6MT, and Sonata Eco, but I'd also take a good look at the new Legacy (living as I do in Minnesnowta), and at least drive the 200, Fusion, and Passat 1.8T. The Altima, Camry, and Malibu don't float my boat, and the Optima, while a good car, is now a generation behind the Sonata. I'd also consider the Jetta 1.8T as it has mid-sized interior and trunk room in a smaller package, and for 2015 the interior is spiffied-up."
[Deleted User],Aug-14,"Mazda 6 GT. It is so curvaceous and sculpted like a work of art. I love the looks, and I love the way it drives. I do not love the center stack. They need to do something there, but it is in no way a deal killer. It was a very good test drive when I took one out about a month ago, and I didn't miss the extra 15 HP my car (allegedly) has."
m6user,Aug-14,"Just read interesting article on autoblog.com about Mazda changes. It's possible the Mazda 6 interior is going to get a redo for 2015. It wouldn't surprise me because that dash/tech is about the only thing that really got panned by reviewers on the 6. They seemed to like the Mazda 3 dash/tech so my guess would be the Mazda 6 is going to get the same look as the uplevel 3.
Here's a link to the article:
http://www.autoblog.com/2014/08/28/mazda-miata-coupe-rumor-mazda6-updates/"
Michaell,Aug-14,"Aother vote for the Mazda 6. Beautiful on the outside, functional on the inside and lots of options normally seen on more expensive cars."
explorerx4,Aug-14,"I'd get another Fusion. A loaded SE/SE Hybrid would work. Been kind of looking around.
Taking a trip to the midwest (flat) next weekend, so I'll see if I can improve on the 28-29 mpg I've been getting."
ab348,Aug-14,"So why are they not selling? There must be a reason, but I never hear why. Do they suffer from the NVH issues that plague the 3?"
Michaell,Aug-14,Can't answer that - I've not driven one.
m6user,Aug-14,They sell about the same number as Subaru sells of the Legend. Neither are their respective brands best sellers. Why doesn't Subaru sell more?? Because they are a small manufacturer with maybe 1/5(or even less) the number of dealerships as the big boys. Same as Mazda. People forget that.
[Deleted User],Aug-14,"I have not heard that NVH was at ""plague"" levels on the 3. I read Motortrend and C/D, and not one article has mentioned NVH problems. Can you point out where you heard or read that?
I drove a black GT when my car was in for service. I walked across the street to the Mazda store, and in less than 10 mins I was on 66 doing 70. It has a really nice growl to the engine, and it sounds refined all the way up to redline. It was easy to place the wheels, the steering was quick and the grip confidence inspiring. Back in the Kia 30 mins later, and it is just numb. Not bad per say, just nothing at all special in the dynamics department.
I think I am going to have a very hard time affording a BMW or Audi that has anything close to the levels of equipment the 6 has. I am not going to fork over good $ for pretentiousness or a badge either."
ab348,Aug-14,"Pretty much from anyone who owns one, eithe rface to face or online in forums, etc. Some of the boy-racer types like it and find it sporty, but many find it too rough and noisy for a compact sedan and seem to get tired of having to put up with it day in and day out. If you never read that in a review, then maybe my suspicions about most reviews being puff pieces are correct."
[Deleted User],Aug-14,"I will ask my neighbor whenever I catch him. He has a 2.5 liter 3 that he got about 6 months ago, if that. Curious."
suydam,Aug-14,I think it has more to do with fewer dealerships. I owned a 6 wagon in 2004. That dealership folded so I didn't even drive one this time around.
[Deleted User],Aug-14,"My wife drive a 6 wagon too. Also a 2004. 240 HP V6, very nice looking car inside and out. A/C broke often and usually when we needed it the most. Other than that, Diane drove the crap out of it and it never left her stranded mechanically, but it did go through wheels and tires a little more often than normal."
stickguy,Aug-14,"Buying by what I want and nit on price, Mazda 6 or accord.
New Mazda 3 is much improved in terms of nvh"
[Deleted User],Aug-14,"August sign and drive deals on Optima at local dealer.
All are zero down...
2015 Optima LX 39 mo. lease - $249 mo + tax and tags
2015 Optima EX 39 mo. lease - $299 mo + tax and tags
2015 Optima SX-T 39 mo. lease - $349 mo + tax and tags
All are base models, options extra.
I usually only see LX deals no matter what the car is; and always wonder why more ads don't include teaser rates like this on a car that people can actually live with for 39 months. My car note is $449 on my EX plus $97 for insurance. I am not one to lease cars, but that $349 deal is very attractive on a turbo....even though it is a base turbo.
Also, on a different topic, my tax bill just arrived with an October 15th due date. It is $369. I know we were talking about tax rates a while back. The DOT value is $16,800."
robr2,Aug-14,"I think it has to do more with the fact that it's a Mazda. If the 6 were branded as a Honda or Nissan, it would sell better. Mazda is a fringe brand compared to the others and as such, it considered a risky purchase."
suydam,Aug-14,I disagree. Mazda has a good reputation. But away from cities there are few dealerships.
robr2,Aug-14,"I'm not saying tha Mazda has a bad reputation. It's just that it's reputation isn't as good as Honda or Toyota. We all have a psychological need to be part of a group and since Mazda is an outlier, it is not as popular.
Now those that want to be seen as different may gravitate to Mazda. But even there, they are still part of a group - those that want to be seen as different."
m6user,Aug-14,Subaru has a very good reputation but it's sales are also low. Everyone can't be huge. Mazda has way less dealerships and people tend to want their dealership handy during warranty. My wife made the final decision on our Mazda and I can assure you it was not because she wanted to be in any kind of group. She didn't have a clue about Mazda and just liked the way it drove in the test drive.
[Deleted User],Aug-14,"I found little info on the Mazda 3 NVH issue. Most reviews stated it was excessive road noise. Mazda really tried to keep the weight down, so it could be just a minimal insulation issue. The motor mounts are fluid filled on all three platform variants so the engine shouldn't be shaking the car apart. NVH is why the inline four was designated a ""4 banger"" in the first place.
I also found that the 3 was the 2nd best selling car in Australia 2013, passed only by the Corolla. So, I don't think Mazda is going to fold any time soon. They really did a good job at sharing three models across one platform (Maz3 Maz6 and CX-5), which greatly reduced cost, and they all are top notch cars.
I also think Subaru did a great job with the new Legacy. It's proportions are right, and it is generally pleasant to look at inside and out. I would save up for the flat 6 if I wanted to do any kind of spirited driving, but speed is not the biggest consideration with loyal Subaru folk. It's the AWD and the promise of returning home safely on icy back roads in the northern States. If I lived in PA,NY,NH,ME or VT I would very much consider one. (and Canada too of course.)"
robr2,Aug-14,"I didn't say everyone bought a Mazda for that reason. But subconsciously, many do buy Mazdas, Subarus or other non-mainstream brands because they consider themselves better than the sheeple that buy Hondas or Toyotas."
backy,Aug-14,"I don't think that's it at all. I think people buy Subarus and Mazdas because they offer something not offered by Toyota or Honda. Subarus offer AWD of course. Try getting that on a Camry or Accord. And Mazdas offer that fun-to-drive element that's missing from almost every Toyota (including the Camry) and even some Hondas (maybe not so much the Accord, but certainly today's Civic).
And those differences could also explain why Subarus and Mazdas sell in much smaller numbers than Toyotas and Hondas. How many people really need AWD in a sedan, and are willing to pay a little more for it? How many people (overall, not just people who post here) really look first and foremost for a mid-sized sedan that's fun to drive, vs. having a quiet, smooth ride?
Now that the Legacy is finally competitive in both price and FE with non-AWD mid-sized cars, it will be interesting to see if sales pick up."
m6user,Aug-14,"People that buy less popular cars may like something a little different but I doubt they think they are better than other people. Maybe that's how you think, robr2, but not me."
suydam,Aug-14,Back in the day we bought a Mazda because we couldn't afford a Honda. Now that price advantage isn't there.
[Deleted User],Aug-14,"He said ""sheeple"" LOL. It gave me a mental image of lines of people, all wearing gray and purchasing grey Camry LE's by the thousand...."
explorerx4,Aug-14,"Didn't get all the details, but I saw a billboard advertising a Camry lease for $57 a month! I'm sure the 'sheeple' are lining up for that one!"
backy,Aug-14,"I hate those kind of lease ads. I saw one like that in today's paper, for a Mitsubishi. Of course, there's a humongous down payment + TTL. I stick to the zero-out-of-pocket leases myself. One big reason I lease cars sometimes is to minimize my up-front costs."
[Deleted User],Aug-14,Like flies to a light bulb....
[Deleted User],Aug-14,"These days it is impossible to watch TV without seeing at least one car insurance commercial during EVERY break. Sometimes there are three adverts per break.
With that said; how much are you guys paying for car insurance on your mid-size, and have any of you shopped around recently and found an extra-awesome low rate?
I will start out. I was a loyal Progressive customer and was paying $124 until I switched to Liberty Mutual 6 months ago. Now I am at $97 with one ticket 2 years ago.
In related advert news, I now hate the Acura TLX commercial more than any other. I believe it includes a bad punk rock band doing a cover...a really bad cover, of Frank Sinatra's ""I did it my way""."
m6user,Aug-14,"Rates vary so much city to city, state to state. Then you have to consider the car itself....age, original sticker etc. Other variables are coverages, deductible, age of drivers(s), gender, marital status, driving record, teenage drivers, miles driven, etc. etc. Comparisons are almost useless.. Maybe there is forum within Edmunds that actually discusses this topic.
We pay about $1500 a year for 3 cars worth about $45k at this time with full collision, $500 deductible and two adult drivers with no tickets or accidents in last 10 years. I don't think that would help you much though. See what I mean."
[Deleted User],Sep-14,"Yes, I get it. I was kind of hoping for a range. I take it most of us are over 30 but under 60, have one ticket or less, and own one car in this class that is being financed.
I was a Progressive guy for 5 years, and was always able to get them to match other quotes...but in the end they were $30 higher than Liberty Mutual so I switched."
backy,Sep-14,"You switched for $30? Wow. I've had Progressive for a couple years now, switched from Farmers after many years because I got a much better deal with Progressive. I've been pleasantly surprised by the service I've received from Progressive. One thing I like about them is they don't ding me for every accident, e.g. my 18-year-old daughter bumped a car in a parking lot a few months ago (it just happened to be an E Class), and I asked Progressive if that would increase my rates. They told me ""accidents happen"" and since I was a loyal customer it wouldn't impact my rates. I recently got a quote from another insurance company that touted a ""special deal"" they have for people from my company. It was double what Progressive charges me. I've also compared Geico and they couldn't get close to the Progressive rates. FWIW I also got Progressive (i.e. Ameriprise) for my homeowner's insurance because they saved me a ton of money over what Farmers was going to charge me, and got better coverage to boot. Had one claim on that, last year, for water damage, and not only did the settlement more than cover my costs, but Progressive refunded my deductible because they went after the manufacturer of the dishwasher that broke (out of warranty) and got a settlement from them."
[Deleted User],Sep-14,"I still shouldn't be dinged ""because of my history"". With three kids to put through college $30 a month saved is $30 a month earned. BTW, when I switched they offered me $124 to come back....but wouldn't budge on the $141 I was really paying until they got a cancellation notice.
Like I said, I was loyal for 5 years, knowing I was paying too much. That is long enough considering the accident wasn't in any way my fault.
BTW backy, they do a lot of marketing to make you feel special, with their ""silver, gold, and platinum"" customer status. That is all horse*&^%. If you want to really feel special you should get a smaller bill, and know they will replace my car with one 1 model year newer and with 15k fewer miles."
akirby,Sep-14,You didn't say $30/month. We thought it was $30/year.
backy,Sep-14,"Yes, $30 a month is real money... $1 a day. I have 3 kids to put through college also (2 down, 1 to go) so I understand that. If ""Platinum"" were just marketing, I'd agree with you, but forgiving an at-fault accident that must have cost them at least $5000 total for both cars backs up their marketing. And I've found their claim service to be fast, and convenient. Had hail damage on my wife's Sonata last year, and I simply drove about a mile to a temporary claims center they'd set up, got the estimate, and they asked me, ""Do you want us to repair it for you (PDR) right now?"" They had brought in a PDR unit. I said, sure. They drove me home, and took care of the car that day. And their PDR provider gave me a nice deal that cut my deductible in half. The other two claims I've had, both on my daughter's car (one her fault) were also handled with no muss, no fuss.
All I'm saying is, it would take me more than $1 a day to switch if I were happy with how I'd been treated overall. Which is why I stayed with Farmers for so long. But when I found out Progressive would save me $2000 a year on car insurance and about $800 a year on homeowner's insurance, it was easy to say farewell to my long-time Farmers agent."

stickguy,Sep-14,"well, I look at a 2014 EX yesterday, and their first offer was $3,600 off MSRP. so yeah, they are discounting.
Serious lease cash on the Camry too."
nyccarguy,Sep-14,"I'm one step closer to taking the plunge and posting with more regularity here in mid sized sedans 2.0 the in Entry Level Luxury Performance Sedans. I stopped by the Subaru Dealer in Rye, NY where I drove the Impreza last week. This time I stopped by to put the newly redesigned 2015 Subaru Legacy through its paces. My test model was a Legacy Limited.
I sat in the car and adjusted its mirrors while my sales guy attached a demo plate. Dash materials are very high quality and soft touch plastics are everywhere. The seats are padded very hard, almost with a Mercedes-like stiffness.
Foot on the brake, shift into Drive, & off I go. I immediately notice how much more responsive the 2.5L is compared to the 2.0 L in the Impreza. The steering does provide decent feedback for being electric, but its still too light for my tastes (to make matter worse, I drove my BMW today).
I hopped on the highway. The engine pulls strongly while the CVT responds to every stab of the throttle. This car will have absolutely no trouble keeping up traffic at the normal 70 - 75 mph clip I usually cruise at.
My biggest issue with the dashboard is its layout. The tach is on the right and the speedo is on the left (My Hondas and my BMW have tach on the left & speedo on the right). This is going to take some getting used to.
The ride is definitely on the taut side of comfortable. Which is fine by me. It rides very close to an old school Honda before they started softening up the suspensions to market to the Camry crowd.
There is a bit more body roll than I like & I'm used to, but again I'm comparing it to my BMW & my Prelude (with thicker sway bars) so take that with a grain of salt.
Handling characteristics are pretty neutral. I took an off ramp a bit faster than I should have (kept looking down at the tach, thinking it was the speedo) and the Legacy definitely didn't under steer.
Brakes seemed pretty good. Pedal feel was linear and progressive. I'm spoiled by my 328xi's stellar stoppers though.
As you can all tell, I liked the car a lot."
stickguy,Sep-14,"you have a built in excuse for when you get stopped for speeding: ""but officer, I was only doing 25!""
oh, and I told you that once you drove the Legacy you would not want to go back down the scale.
Your review certainly fits with my impressions. Plus it was quite roomy, even lots of headroom with the moonroof.
and it is a double edge sword comparing to the BMW, but you will get over that. Everything has lighter steering. I used to notice a lot more on our RDX (certainly vs. the old TL) but have since adjusted and no longer notice it.
overall, I liked the feel/drive on the Legacy more than the Accord I drove the day after. Odd. Plus I still like the Camry XLE a lot for some reason, but could not quite convince myself to pull the trigger. For me, it is down to the Camry and Legacy, and since the Camry is a 2014, if I diddle a bit longer it will no longer be an option!"

Really, Mazda needs to figure this out. It is almost an embarrassment. The automotive press falls all over themselves to shower it with praise, and nobody wants one."
backy,Sep-14,"Actually, there IS a shortage of Mazda6s.
http://www.autoblog.com/2013/09/23/mazda-low-supply-high-sales/
The article notes that Mazda has trouble supplying enough Mazda6s, built in Japan, to the US market.
Mazda USA sales increased 26% in 2012 and another 2.5% in 2013, their best year since 2007. Retail sales in 2013 increased 16% over 2012, as Mazda cut back on fleet sales.
In 2013, Mazda sold 43,638 Mazda6s here. For 2014 through August, 37,598 Mazda6s have been sold... over 8,000 more than YTD sales in August 2013 and just 6,000 behind all of 2013. August sales were 32.5% higher than August 2013.
The CX-5 is also selling well. The biggest disappointment for Mazda USA is the new Mazda3, for which sales to date are less than in 2013 despite an all-new model. Plus Mazda can supply more Mazda3s than before with the Mexico plant coming online."
m6user,Sep-14,"Mazda is a small auto manufacturer. So is Subaru. Kind of a niche market as Mazda markets to the people that want a sporty family hauler. Most people looking for midsize sedans in this category don't care all that much about sporty handling as it usually affects the softer and quieter ride. Looking at the numbers in some sort of context is better than just rattling off monthly sales numbers. Thanks Backy for providing some context. I just fail to understand why this concept is so hard to understand. If I had a burger chain with 10 outlets I would sell a lot less burgers than McDonalds. Doesn't mean I can't make money and it doesn't mean my burgers are any worse. Just smaller numbers.
Chrysler Corp has some outstanding numbers overall this year. Plus they have dealerships in nearly every little town across America. People usually have to visit bigger cities to find a Mazda dealer."
brian125,Sep-14,"Mazda6 GT,
$33K plus is just too high for a car with that engine. Underpowered. Dynamically, the Passat is its closet competitor, and for that price it offers a more sophisticated powertrain - a direct injected narrow angle VR6 with blistering 5.6 seconds to 60 with a dual clutch DSG - and lest we forget that the standard 1.8FSI engine gets the same mileage as the Mazda engine, with much improved performance (0-60 7.3). It also offers nicer and better thought out interiors and infotainment screens - all in package that's quieter, rides better, and is more refined. That being said the Passat isn't selling like it should be. Maybe its the bland looks and the previous years reliability record that's hurting this vehicle.. The 2015 Passat I think is a big overall improvement. Car, Motor choices, and Trans. I'm waiting to see what the experts have to say about this new model. Have you noticed the Passat sales are climbing for Aug. The 2015 model sales will double by next year due to the upgraded motors and trans. options.
The other things I did not like about the Mazda6 was ;
The Mazda6 is very tight inside for a 6' plus person. When I drove the 6 in Feb., the vehicle we test drove had the moonroof. My head was hitting the roof. Hip room was tight. Back seat egress / ingress is not as good for a family of 4 compared to the Accord , Fusion, Altima etc.
Mazda handling was exceptional. Underpowered motor @184h/p. To much road noise inside cabin for me.
Mazda sales were better in August. There just not going to get the average family folks to buy this vehicle cause its sporty looking or can take a turn better. Those buyers wont be persuaded. Mazda's sales numbers prove that.
I help a lot of people get better deals on vehicle pricing. In the family sedan market I have nobody asking for help with a Mazda6. I find it odd. But it proves some of my theories.
Honda , Ford , Nissan , Hyundai, Kia , Toyota is where most people are buying.
Mazda should make this vehicle with bigger engine choices / Trans. . A turbo, Diesel and go after the sports car sales. A poor mans........... BMW, Audi, etc.
My 32 year old son said if there was a upgrade motor or turbo in the Mazda 6 he would of bought it. Instead he spent more $ and bought the BMW."
backy,Sep-14,"$33k is too much for ANY mid-sized family sedan, IMO. You can get a fine mid-sized family sedan for a little more than half that amount. It won't have 18"" wheels or leather or every technical gizmo known to mankind, but a roomy, comfortable, economical, safe, reasonably powerful, and in some cases great looking and fun to drive car. For example, a Mazda6 Sport can be had for a little over $20k. An Accord LX, about the same. For a little less, a base Fusion or Sonata or Optima.
If I were to spend $33k for a car, it wouldn't be a car designed to sell for under $20k in base form. It would most likely be a gently-used entry luxury car such as a 3 Series or A4."
brian125,Sep-14,"A good price point . Mazda has done a bad job not separating the lower end models motor to higher end. Same motor choice. A bigger motor would generate more sales for this car. The sales numbers suggest family buyers are not interested in this vehicle. Lower or higher end. Although a Turbo motor could possible steal money away from BMW, Audi's lower end models. Not many family buyers are going to drop down 30 to 33k for the upper model Mazda. Option a 300 h/p motor for under 30k. Now you have a contender in the sports car segment. Ride, Handling, Power, Fun to drive would be a homerun for the price. Family sedan not happen
Why is it Chrysler's 200 doubled sales on the Mazda 6 in August. Is it because its a better car ? reviews suggest its not. More Chrysler dealerships? Deeper discounts? Does Chrysler offer more upgraded motor sizes? or options for the money. Why is the Accord , Camry, 9x the sales of the Mazda6. Lower end models suggest pricing is about the same. With reviews being stellar for Mazda
I'm scratching my head on this. I buy the lower end Mazda 6 over the Chrysler 200 any day. Its a no brainer to me. With Ride, handling, reliability and resale on my side.
Just some thoughts on why>."
akirby,Sep-14,"Chrysler 200 jump is probably due to fleet sales, but I'm just guessing. Some of us like those 19"" wheels and other amenities. I would buy a loaded Focus before I bought a base Fusion, but that's just me."
m6user,Sep-14,"Chrysler has 2,390 dealerships in the U.S. and Mazda has 637. That is about 4 times as many dealers. Based on the sales numbers some people are so hung up on, Mazda sold twice as many Mazda6s per dealer than Chrysler did 200s. God! Yuk! Chrysler needs to step it up. LOL.
From my limited experience, most Mazda dealers are usually quite a bit smaller in size than Chrysler dealers but I'm sure there are exceptions. But my original premise still stands that Mazda has a smaller footprint than many other car makes in the U.S. and is most comparable in size to Subaru which sells similar numbers of midsize sedans. It's funny how nobody is always saying Subaru must sell a lot more cars but Mazda does.
I don't think it has that much to do with not offering a model with more horsepower and I would dare say that the Skyactiv technology is certainly as advanced as anything from VW. With the i-eloop or whatever it's called capacitor, the Mazda6 gets 40mpg highway on regular gas. Could they sell a few more with a bigger engine? Sure, and I'm sure they considered that. But with limited manufacturing capability they seem to want to simplify their line up. They probably figure they won't sell a ton of the GT for $33k but there are some people that want every bell and whistle available. I do agree that for $33k, the decked out model is expensive but if you look at the amount of safety tech that it has that many other makes don't even have, it isn't such a stretch. I just think it's a niche brand that doesn't appeal to the majority of family sedan buyers but has it's followers just like Subaru does. They are both good cars, just like most of the others.
As far as price, the GT vs. the Accord EX-L. Very similar HP/TQ numbers. The base Mazda6 Grand Touring cost about $1400 more than the EX-L. For that you get the following additional items.
Standard Navigation with voice recognition
11 speaker Bose system
HID headlights
Directional headlights
Blind spot sensors
19"" alloys vs. 17"" on the Accord.
Not saying it's a great deal but probably worth the extra $1400. So, IMO, it's not really overpriced compared to others, but certainly up there in price."
ab348,Sep-14,"Well, it is an interesting debate. Is Mazda underperforming because of their small dealer network or is the car not what consumers really want? Even though all the auto reviewers absolutely love the Mazda 6, the shortcomings of the car have been noted by a few posters. These never seem to factor into the reviews."
m6user,Sep-14,"What is your definition of underperforming? Profit per car? Cars sold per dealership? Compared to what? They are tremendously up over last year and hiring engineers like crazy. I used to work in retail management eons ago but there used to be a saying that still applies today......sales without profits is a fools delight.
Auto reviewers, I assume, like to drive and probably drive hard. What would you think they would like to drive better, a Mazda6 or a Camry? Of course the reviewers like the Mazda6 and it's probably that same reason that many family buyers don't like it. It's a niche vehicle. Is that so hard to comprehend that they are are a small company and will never, ever come close to big boys. And guess what, they don't have to to make decent profits."
brian125,Sep-14,"FYI; Mazda dealers need to make a decent profit. 74 Mazda dealerships have closed since 2006. There are only 637 left.
A small company like Mazda needs all there products to pull there own weight to stay afloat. I do agree with some of @m6user posts on Mazda's in general. Mazda is going in the right direction as is Subaru with there vehicles. The Gov't gave GM our money and the tax payers are 10 billion in dept.
Thank you GM For crappy vehicles and a mis-managed company. When Gm decides to pay back the money we lost on the loan is when they see my hard earn money again."

maxamillion85,Sep-14,"Finally got a new car...chose the Fusion! I've had it for about two week but haven't really had time to do a full review on the car yet...here goes.
Pros:
-Styling, one of the best in class...along with Optima and Mazda6
-Interior materials/design- Everything is high quality (except the leather upholstery) the entire interior feels ""premium"" compared to the competition
-6spd manual availability-at least for now, mine is nearly loaded and the 6spd is smooth
-Feature content-leather, moonroof, navigation, I'm loving all the content.
-Sharp handling, reminds me a lot of my 1991 Accord
-Fuel economy so far has been excellent, surprising given the fact that its a turbo four
-Pricing-Excellent price on mine, 0 percent for 60, I cannot complain!
Cons:
-No push button start...Ford is stupid for not making it standard on all ""SE"" Fusions
-18 inch wheels...I think the design of the Nickel finished wheels is kinda boring...the same wheels in gloss black are sexy though
-CHEAP leather upholstery-already showing signs of wear...good thing I got the black interior
-MyFord Touch is a bit glitchy and lacks Pandora capability...the voice commands are hit and miss as well
-It turns like a BOAT, I HATE parking this thing in my garage spot
-Clutch is SUPER light...I have to catch myself sometimes...gonna take some getting used to.
The Competition:
Essentially I was down to the Mazda6 i Grand Touring and the Ford Fusion SE 1.6t/6spd manual. Had the 6 GT been available with a stick shift and a more updated infotainment system the choice would have been much tougher. It was a hard choice but overall the Fusion just made the most sense and won out over the 6.
I drove the Accord EX-L I4/CVT, the Optima EX 2.4, Mazda6 i GT and Nissan Altima 2.5SV/SL. The Passat and Camry were not considered at all...too bland and too boring. The Sonata was not considered either, I don't particularly care for the styling of the 2014 or 2015 Sonatas.
Mazda6 i GT: The Driver's Choice...with too many compromises
Pros:
-Exterior Styling...best in the class IMO
-Sharp handling, better than anything else in the class
-Excellent fuel economy
-Best in class interior materials, the leather is superb
Cons:
-Worst infotainment system ever....terrible graphics, terrible location/placement of controls and ridiculously small screen
-Low seating position....while the interior itself has excellent materials, I just couldn't get used to how low the car felt to the ground
-6spd automatic just feels sluggish compared to the CVT in the Accords
-Wind noise is not good
I drove the 6 and Fusion back to back at least three times...as much as I liked the styling of the 6, I just could not stand the infotainment system. I was really wanting another stick shift sedan (my 07 Accord was a manual) and try as I might the 6 just wasn't as fun with the automatic transmission as the Fusion was with a stick (The Fusion automatic would never, ever be considered by me) Small, outdated graphics, tiny screen, terrible Tom Tom design, I just hated it. When the car gets an updated interior for 2016 (as rumored) I might reconsider it...the lack of manual transmission was just another nail in the coffin regardless.
Accord EX-LI4: The Accountants Choice...excellent value, smart buy but BORING
Pros:
-Roomy interior, car just feels roomy and airy, more so than anything else I drove.
-Feature content galore...LDW, Lanewatch, Forward Warning collision
-Excellent ride quality
-Fuel efficiency
Cons:
-Bland styling (exception-Sport)
-Cheap interior materials
-Strange, overly complex interior design
-CVT only, its a great CVT, but its still a CVT and I hate them honestly
I WANTED another Accord, I really really did. I've posted thousands of times about how much I like the current Accord...but its just no longer the ""car"" for me. Its competent, its roomy, its affordable and offers an excellent value but I'm bored with them. Honda needs to expand the Sport trim levels, rework the interior design and use better interior materials. The carpeting inside the new Accords is so thin that its pathetic, door cards/window switches are pre- bankruptcy GM terrible. Handling is competent, but the car is never ""fun"" Give me a Sport EX-L with 6spd manual or even paddle Shifters and perhaps I may replace the Fusion in a few years.
Kia Optima EX: Bargain of the Year...but showing its age.
Pros:
-Feature content...loaded to the gills...leather, pano roof, heated/cooled front seats, etc. etc. LOTS of content
-Pricing...with discounts its a steal
-Handsome interior design
Cons:
-Bland, only the SX/SX-T models look interesting and the pre-facelifted models were classier
-Cheap interior materials...better than the Accord, but not nearly as nice as the Fusion/Mazda6
-Mushy handling...H/K have come a long way but the cars still lack refinement
I loved the Optima (and Sonata) it was first redesigned in 2010, now the cars are showing their ages. It still a handsome car in most senses but the updates for 2014 and 2015 aren't exactly pluses. The car packs lots of content, has excellent pricing and does everything ""well"" but they just don't feel as refined as the competition, they lack the polish and finesse of the Fusion and Mazda6 and probably won't match the reliability of the Accord.
Nissan Altima 2.5SV/SL: The Toyota Camry Alternative
Pros:
-Some neat content (tire monitor that beeps at you when the tires or too full or too low, remote engine start, rain sensing headlamps)
-Roomy interior
-High quality interior materials
-FAST
-Fuel efficient
Cons:
-Styling that manages to be both bland and ugly
-Bland as white bread interior design
-CVT sucks
-Lack of feature content compared to the class competition
-Most unrefined engine I've driven in a midsize sedan
I owned a 2005 Altima before my last Accord and I loved the styling, loved the outright acceleration but hated everything else about it after a few years. The new Altima is better in every way compared to my old 05, but it seriously lacks the refinement of the others, Kia Optima included. Its got an excellent set of interior materials and some ""neat"" convenience features but the car overall just lacks something. The Engine is bi-polar in that it gets excellent fuel economy and has excellent acceleration but it just feels dated (because it is) and the CVT is not nearly as good as the Accords. Nissan's styling as of late leaves a lot to be desired and just doesn't come off as appealing at all. Pricing is also not that great from my experience.
Overall I'm very happy with my choice...the only thing I would have done differently is gotten the Gloss Black 18 inch wheels and perhaps the Driver Assist pkg (LDW, BLIS, rain sensing wipers, etc) I was willing to deal with a dealership out in Connecticut to get exactly what I wanted but the customer service (and the sales tactics turned me all the way off) Glad I got my car from the dealership I got it from...the service was EXCELLENT...thanks Golf Mill Ford in Niles, IL!
Here are a few pics...its ""Darkside"" (Dark green/gray/black/blue) with ""Charcoal"" Leather interior

brian125,Sep-14,Nice reviews. enjoy your new ride.
benjaminh,Sep-14,"The Accord may be the Accountants choice, but we beat the Fusion going 0-60, for mpg, and in resale and reliability...."
jpp75,Sep-14,Congrats on the new Fusion and thanks for a great review. I really like the Dark Side color.
akirby,Sep-14,SE is really the base Fusion model. S is only for fleets and advertising purposes. A lot of people don't want push button start so it's good that it's optional.
maxamillion85,Sep-14,"Reliability for both is yet to be determined honestly...I've been reading some reports of CVT issues with the Accords on DriveAccord.net and the DI technology in the Accords is no guarantee either so far I haven't had an issue with my Fusion so we'll see I'll take that risk.
I got my car at X-plan pricing minus $2750 in rebates, plus ZERO percent financing. I'm not worried about resale value...I'm never going to trade the thing if its half as reliable as my Accord was. I read somewhere that only about 2200 manual Fusions were even produced for MY2013 and 2014. I'm gonna hold on to mine.I like the uniqueness of it. I pull up into a drive thru and people are like ""that's a stick, I didn't know the Fusion came in stick""
0-60 means absolutely nothing to me in a midsize family sedan. As long as I have the power when I need it (so far this car has held its own in Milwaukee traffic quite nicely) I'm ok with that. I'm averaging right around 27 MPG in all urban city driving in the Fusion so far...and that's with an enjoyable, fun to drive manual transmission. Something Honda refuses to give me with anything above a spartan Accord EX."
maxamillion85,Sep-14,"Another issue with the Accord (and I've been totally vocal about this) is the interior design and materials. The Civic got panned for its cheapness, the new Accord isn't as bad as the 2012 Civic was, but its a sharp decline in quality compared to my old 07. Cheap carpets, brittle feeling door panels and lower dash plastics, overly complicated dual screen system, it just needs a total revision IMO. The only thing the Accord has that I wish my Fusion had is Pandora capability. The bluetooth streaming option is nice, but to have the full capability built into the interface would be nicer."
maxamillion85,Sep-14,"The SE is not the base model...its the mid trim level...the dealership I bought my Fusion from had a great deal of 14 and 15 S models available...and when an SE is equipped like mine is (MSRP of $30,555) its almost as loaded as a Titanium. Perhaps Ford should have kept the SEL models around or something but for the pricing, Push button start should have been in the cards. It's an available option on SE models, but you gotta get saddled with the automatic transmission to get it. It would have been a nice ""gee-wiz"" option but I can live without it. My Mustang will have it when I get it No worries.
Nissan and Chrysler make it standard on all their cars. Its available on mid trim Sonatas, Accord and Camrys.
I've been on these boards for YEARS...I remember back in the days when the discussions used to get heated on here lol. Started out lusting over the 2000 Maxima, ended up getting a 2005 Altima for high school graduation, traded it for my 07 Accord, which got traded for the Fusion.
Funny thing is, back then all I'd consider where Accords, Camrys, Passats and Altimas. Now, at the ripe ole age of 28, three of those cars I would never consider, one I would have bought if it had been available in the combination I wanted (I'm looking at you Accord) and now I'm driving a Ford. Never thought I'd see the day where I'd purchase a Fusion...I could have never said that about the Taurus from way back in those days.
I'm loving this car so far."
ab348,Sep-14,"It seems rather foolhardy to produce a vehicle that misses many of the key things that buyers are looking for in that segment. @maxamillion85 identifies many of those issues in his review. Wind and road noise at unacceptable levels, a bad infortainment system, poor seating position and visibility. My point in my original post was really about the credibility of reviewers/review sites and their inability to identify these as issues. I get that all these people who write about cars want everything to drive and handle like a Porsche. But that is foolish in the midsize family sedan segment. Did any of them even think to mention this disconnect? It is almost as bad as reading the comments on any review from the 20-something kids who mod their cars and think everyone should drive something lowered, chipped, that bounces over bumps and sounds like a chainsaw. A family midsizer doesn't have to handle like a bowl of Jello, but neither should it punish the occupants with NVH and basic issues of visibility, access, and ease of use.
My comment about ""underperforming"" was based upon reports in Automotive News and elsewhere that came from people who would know. If Mazda is disappointed in sales, then I guess it is underperforming. I think they took a chance with this design, so good for them, but it is not working out."
suydam,Sep-14,"Maxamillion85, good review and enjoy your Fusion. It's a good thing there are so many choices because we have such different impressions. I never drove the Fusion but did drive Altima and Accord before getting the Accord. What you consider boring, I call classic. I love the interiors of both Altima and Accord, and I really love the Accord's dual screen system. But what sold me on the Accord was the driving experience, the great visibility, turning agility and fuel economy. A year and a half later I still love it. There are a few things I don't like about it of course, namely the stereo quality. I hope in a year's time you love your Fusion as much!"
maxamillion85,Sep-14,"Thanks man! Glad you are loving your Accord. I've got my fingers crossed on the Fusion..if it performs well, I'll reward Ford by purchasing a Mustang next."
maxamillion85,Sep-14,"Another reason I think the 6 sold pretty poorly last year was packaging. Up until MY2015, the only way you could get a sunroof in a Mazda6 was to go for the fully loaded Grand Touring. That was a STUPID decision on Mazda's part and was corrected for MY2015. You cannot get the moonroof pkg on the Touring model with a stick shift though.
Its a wonderful driver's cars...but it still seems compromised where it matters to most consumers. Add in the fact that its pricing is a bit higher than Camcords (but its equipped nicer) and its easy to see why the car doesn't sell well. Having a TINY dealership network also doesn't help. I will say this though. I'd expect the 6 to probably be more reliable than the Fusion.
Mazda's quality for the most part is just as good as Honda and Toyotas. Nissan's quality is not all that great IMO."
suydam,Sep-14,"I didn't drive a 6 when I was shopping because --- only 1 dealer in my area and I don't like them. But I have owned Mazdas and they were very reliable. As for Nissans, my last midsize was a Maxima and that was a great car. And I have a lot of friends with Altimas who love them."
ab348,Sep-14,"Up here in the salt belt, Mazdas still have a reputation for premature rusting. Loyalists say that's no longer true and that they have finally addressed that problem. But the reputation sticks, and seeing lots of early-mid 2000s Mazda 3s on the roads with significant rust probably doesn't help. Once those go away maybe the rep will change, assuming it actually has been fixed.
My perception, not based on any actual firsthand experience mind you, is that I agree with your assessment of Nissan quality. When I look at them on the dealer lots, they remind me of Hyundais, built to a price."
benjaminh,Sep-14,"Thanks for your reports. Sounds like you got a great deal on a very good car. The Fusion is definitely one of the top cars out there, and for your needs it sounds like it was the best.
Congrats!
But I'm just slightly puzzled by your comment that ""0-60 means absolutely nothing to me in midsize family sedan.""
Every time I get on the freeway I test out my car's 0-60 speed. And I have to admit my 2008 Accord 5 MT is a little lacking in that dept. That's why the new generation of 6MT Accord, which gets from 0-60 almost a second and a half quicker than my car, has some appeal. Heck, even the CVT of the new Accord even gets faster from 0-60.
Another point where clearly we'll need to agree to disagree is the idea that an EX Accord is ""spartan.""
Since the EX has a moonroof, pushbutton start, an exclusive Lanewatch side camera, 17"" alloys with V rated tired, back up camera, smart phone integration, etc., etc. I'd hardly call it ""spartan."" Not even the LX, which is two steps down is really spartan in my book. I think the materials are very nice inside, except for the carpet, which I admit seems a bit rough. But I'm 49, and so I grew up with cars with manual steering, no ac, and sometimes without even a stereo until we put one in --lol!
But, anyway, I'm sure your Fusion will give you years of great service. Congratulations again on getting a great deal on a very fine car....+++"
maxamillion85,Sep-14,"My point regarding 0-60 times is simple...its not a huge concern for me. My Accord was probably faster 0-60 than my new Fusion is...yet the Fusion handles nicer, has way more content, looks a whole lot better...If my Fusion is a second slower to 60 than the Accord (it is) I'm not concerned about it. Even when I get ready to pull the trigger on the Mustang in a few years, outright acceleration won't matter so much to me as long as it can move out of its way and is entertaining to drive. I buy midsize sedans for their room, comfort, content and serviceable reliability. 0-60 just isn't high on my list.
The EX's cloth interior, drab interior plastic colors, average interior materials (especially the Gray interior) and lack of XM give the car a spartan feel to me. This is the Accord Hybrid's interior which is the Equivalent to the EX sedan...
It's nicer than a Camry...but the Altima 2.5SV, Fusion SE, Optima EX and Sonata Sport models have nicer interiors at the ""midlevel"" point where the Accord is.
I'm not saying the content is ""Spartan"" not even a base model Civic is ""spartan"" per se anymore but the design just looks drab below the EX-L. The Sport looks nicer too because of the SI seats and red lighting.
I actually find the LX and Sport alloys to be nicer with their polished finish than the EX/EX-L/Touring wheels for the US market. The aren't terrible but they don't look like upgraded wheels over the lower trim levels.
My first accessory to my new Fusion will be illuminated kick plates...I'm ordering them later this month for my 29th birthday!"
suydam,Sep-14,Naturally all black mode looks drab. But as I say it's very subjective. I have the EX-L and it's different from that.
akirby,Sep-14,There are 26K Fusion SE models in dealer stock according to cars.com compared to 2300 S models and 4700 Titaniums. S models are for fleet and advertising purposes only. In 2013 you couldn't even get push button start on a SE model. At least they made it an available option (just not with the manual).
maxamillion85,Sep-14,"If they are just for advertising purposes and fleet only, what would my Fusion be, exactly? Since Ford only made about 2200 Fusion SE 6spd manuals for MY2013 and 2014 combined. The S is still the base model..and its not just for advertising and fleet... Golf Mill Ford (the dealership I bought my Fusion from) is supposedly the largest volume dealer in Chicago and in the Midwest...they've got 29 Fusion S models and only 13 Fusion Titaniums. Apparently somebody outside of your local rental agency is buying them.
Also, I used to be a truck driver, so anytime I traveled anywhere I'd always rent cars...everytime I was offered a Fusion or a Focus I was always offered the SE models. As a matter of fact, the last time I rented a Fusion I ended up with SE model loaded similarly to my own Fusion...but with automatic of course. The fleet Fusions I see on the streets are SE models as well. Ford also added the ""S"" Hybrid to the lineup for MY2014, right? I see quite a bit of those on the roads too. Not sure if those are fleet or just sales.
I don't believe half of what I read on Cars.com when it comes to actual inventory. When I was searching for a new Fusion a few months ago I looked up listing on Cars.com which said about 250 manual transmission Fusions were available across the country, by the time I weeded thru the listing only about 150 or so were acutally manuals...and of those that were actally manuals the listings were outdated and at least 20 of the cars were already sold.
Either way the Fusion is an excellent car, even without the push button start. I'll get my push button start in my Mustang in about four years."
akirby,Sep-14,Ford projects the S model at 10% of sales with virtually NO options. It's limited for a reason.
akirby,Sep-14,"Also - I said fleet sales, not rental car sales. Governments buy a lot of base models with no options."
m6user,Sep-14,"0-60 times are obviously important to a few people. But the vast, and I mean vast, majority of buyers of these cars don't know and don't care. They are all similar in HP, weigh about the same and can accelerate safely. Whether one car is 1 second faster to 60 than another is just not a factor. I look at the 0-60 times only to see if a car is abnormally slow or quick. Haven't ever found a big difference in the midsize arena with an I4 engine. Now if you really want to race, get a v6 or higher hp turbo but most people in this category are looking for MPG, not to be a boy racer. I think if it were that important to their customers the manufactures would be advertising it."
maxamillion85,Sep-14,"@akirby said:
Also - I said fleet sales, not rental car sales. Governments buy a lot of base models with no options.
I know they do, but the vast majority of those ""fleet"" sales are still the SE models.
@akirby said:

10 percent of 250000 is still 25000 a year....that's a pretty sizable number for a base model, I'd suppose.
Question...why do you even care? It's really not that serious LOL"
maxamillion85,Sep-14,"Exactly...I was chatting with my aunt the other day about new cars...she's looking at the 2014 Impala or a slightly used Terrain...I asked her if the Impala was an I4, she swore I was asking if it was a 2014...when I explained to her if it was an I4 (4 cylinder engine) she thought it had something to do with the transmission...there are PLENTY of other people out there like her. LOL"
akirby,Sep-14,I was only pointing out that the SE is still the volume model and as such they want customers to be able to choose whether they want push button start or not. They don't want to force buyers who don't want it to get a S model because that precludes all of the other options. It's just smart marketing to make it optional.
dudleyr,Sep-14,"I have an '07 and a '13 and don't find the interior to be cheaper. There are a few minor things that are a little cheaper (sun visors, storage cubbys) but pretty much everything else is nicer. I considered the Fusion as it has a nice ride and handling, but it has some downsides as well. The base cloth is appalling, and the engines are rather weak with fairly poor real world mpg (the stick would certainly help alleviate these though). In CR tests the most efficient Fusion got worse mileage than the V-6 Accord - major fail for ecoboost in my book. To make matters worse the fastest ecoboost (2.0) is no faster than the base I4 Accord (0-60 in 6.6 seconds).
The Fusion does feel a little more planted than the Accord - wish the electric steering was a little heftier at highway speeds. Ironic since electric steering makes tuning the steering effort a piece of cake."
explorerx4,Sep-14,"Maybe under some kind of ideal condition a 4cyl Accord can match a 2.0 ecoboost Fusion 0-60.
In the real world, not a chance. Top of the line Accord interior is very plain. If anyone watched the Fusion review I linked to a week or so ago, I agree with something the reviewer said. When you look at the Fusion, you can see every part of the car had some thought put into it. Just got back from a road trip and averaged 31 mpg. Pretty good, considering the pace, payload, and terrain. Unless I wanted to pass something, the engine made enough power so that the transmission rarely had to downshift going up any grade."
dudleyr,Sep-14,"Real world is where it does it. Consumer reports acceleration tests are closer to the real world than any other magazine and they get the Fusion 2.0 at 7.4 seconds to 60. They got the CVT Accord at 7.7 seconds, but the Accord has a stick available (not so for the 2.0 Fusion) and can cut about another second. CR did not test the stick, but every mag that did got it about a second faster than the CVT. So really I undersold the Accord when I said it was as fast.
Mpg is the same story. The 1.5 liter with the 6 speed automatic gets 16 city 34 highway in CR's real world tests for 24 overall. On the exact same real world test the Accord was 21 city 40 highway 30 overall. That is a huge difference. Even the 3.5 V-6 Accord beat the 1.5 Fusion by getting 16 city 39 highway and 26 overall. Accord is not alone, the Altima and Mazda6 were better still for mpg at 31 overall.
Just not very impressed with the Ecoboost, but the best of the lot is certainly the 1.6 with the stick.
I realize my personal numbers are anecdotal, but I have been over 45 mpg on a 400 mile trip - using just over half a tank of gas. This is nice weather with no a/c on backroads - no high speed interstate cruising. 31 mpg would be all city driving for me. Never anywhere near that low on the highway.
I think the Fusion is a very nice vehicle with a good ride and handling, but the ecoboost engines offer no advantage over a well engineered naturally aspirated engine, and actually under perform in comparison."

Not sure about the backup camera...but if it doesn't then it is a deal killer. I was told 24k was doable. Wish me luck. I just don't want my car for 5 more years. I am actually hoping they misquoted on a GT...which has all the goodies. I di not want the stop-start feature...so I am having it disabled. Also, I am tall and if it has a sunroof that rubs my head...then I need to get a 6 w/o one.

Obviously I like the two black interior models. The stick would be great if I lived in a more rural or light suburban area...but alas I do not. So, the last picture is my choice. Black on black GT, and Judy said $25k is doable with my trade. So, They give me 16,600 for my car, netting. me. 3000 down (I owe $13,600 an d it is worth 16,680 avg trade.
So, Payment wise? Exactly the same. $450 and 2.9 %. _ am going ton argue about the rate. I want 1.9...but I am also thinking about going for 72 month financing, whjich will bring the payment down to 390. Not to shabby. I can't wait till they open!!!
Oh, Kirby, if I could get a Fusion SE 2.0 Ecoboost, backup camera, dual zone climate control, power drives seat AND at least a manual height and fore/aft adjustment on the passenger seat, plus heated seats......then I would certainly drive over to Ford and check one out."

""It even has fog lights and leather heater seats.""
Doesn't the Touring model have the ""pleather"" seats vs. real leather? I actually like that model myself as it is hard to tell the difference between the fake and real leather in the Mazda and the price is very good for the equipment you get. Plus the fact that you don't have to have a sunroof which I've no use for. I wish they wouldn't package the Bose and the sunroof together though."
[Deleted User],Sep-14,"I don't care if it is pleather or leather. I want durable more than anything. Real leather would be nice though. I have a burn hole in the center of the drivers seat. It happened the 2nd week I had it. I didn't get it fixed because I am superstitious and something worse would have happened. Nothing in this life is perfect. Especially the handling on my Optima. I have not made it over to Mazda yet....stuck at the doctorrs office.
Anyway, will let you guys know the total breakdown on price and all the other things they try to get out of me...ad my wallet."
ahightower,Sep-14,"Good luck, cski! We look forward to lots of good photos.
We're just back from the Big Mouse Trip. The new Pathfinder was an excellent cruiser. 18 hours each way, we went straight through. Set the cruise on 78 for most of the way, which had it turning about 2200 rpm. AC blowing constantly, five people and our stuff, did about 22.5 overall. It's rated 26 highway, which I believe would be doable at lower speeds and/or cooler temps. But I was more interested in making time than saving the planet. The temp needle never rose above normal, even though we never stopped long enough to let the engine cool down. Gas and junk food, 15 minutes tops. Very smooth ride, supportive seats, firm enough steering that you don't have to make constant corrections or have a lot of play in the wheel as with ye olde Yukon. Great handling in the rain, very little hydroplaning. Plenty of passing power, it did not seemed burdened by the load at all. Two minor complaints: Cruise control tends to let you drop 3-4 mph before catching up again on hills. Also, the center screen at its dimmest setting is still a little too bright for my liking at night time. I rested my phone over it to reduce the glare (I have admittedly poor night vision anyway, and would have preferred less contrast, or a ""screen off"" option). Otherwise, an ideal road tripper.
Gave it a good hand wash and vacuum, now it's happy to sit in the garage and rest for a while.
To return to the topic of midsize sedans... as pleased as I was with the Pathfinder, it makes my Accord feel like a 'Vette by comparison. Driving to work and rowing my own again was a real pleasure."

[Deleted User],Sep-14,"I went over to Mazda today. I took home a Touring with the 19"" wheels, and all of the interior goodies. The GT wants to sell a lot of Nannies. They tried to ""bundle"" the back up camera with all kinds of ""plus items"" I didn't need. When they wouldn't budge, I just picked up my stuff, and asked for my keys back. Then the salesperson had to ""ask the manager"". Needless to say, all I want is the heated seats, red color, and backup camera. Also, GPS would be nice. The car I have home now has a backup camera as part of a ""technology package"". After I discussed this sales tactic with the GM, informing them that they are standard on many competitors and are required on all cars in 2 years.
My car is worth 16,800, and that is the real NADA trade, not all these other phony books. I owe $13,280

So, $26,460 - $3520 = 22,940. That is almost exactly what I paid for the Kia. Now I need to do some thinking, and some extremely aggressive driving in the Mazda 6. Don't worry though, they only had silver one the lot, so it is not my car I will be dogging.

The sales manager does not want the deal....he called it ""insider information that puts the dealer at a disadvantage"". Well, too effin bad. You don't feel bad when you sell a customer a ""full boat"" of credit insurance"". So, I will only deal with the Gen Manager.

So, Rosenthal Mazda, the game is on. Are you all men enough to take a low profit deal, or will you wuss out because the deal is not enough in your favor. I truly am curious what their reaction will be. So far, I think I will be buying at Browns Nissan Mazda. At least they didn't attempt to BS me, and Fairfax Kia is right across the street. They would LOVE to steal a sale from Fairfax Kia.

Ok, so, enough outta me. Wish me luck. I really am nice, but I have to put on my game face for these bozos."

Too much heat in fact. In the summer, at stoplights, I had to get out, pop the hood, and twist the wires together for the fan to cool the radiator. I had a cassette deck in it. It only fast forwarded. You had to eject and flip the tape over to rewind it. Also, I put 6x9 speakers in shoe boxes so the stereo would sound loud enough.

I don't see anything wrong with my post. I was pointing out that I prefer people's real experiences, rather than just repeating something in a magazine.
I could have written that the post was somewhat disingenuous, in that it left out that the car being cited had to have the clutch replaced @30k, and the rotors resurfaced every 10k. In reality, you can't even do that with the rotors (shave them 3 times). The dealer probably just replaced then each time because the car was a car mag long termer and wrote it up as a rotor resurface.

Well, you just saved a lot of money.

Would you consider a Honda Accord Sport? Much better visibility, and acceleration that's should be at least on par with your Optima.

Some people down the street us from just got a black Accord Sport day before yesterday. That is one sharp looking car, I have to say. The dual exhausts, large wheels, nice alloys, and spoiler lend it an upscale and yet racy look at the same time. They traded in their Acura, and yet this one looks if anything even better in their driveway. Looks more expensive than the price imho. I think some people were getting 2014 Sport CVTs for as low as c. 21k + TTL. But that was during the blow-out last month. Prices are probably a bit higher now."
stickguy,Sep-14,"you sure about the 0-60? Unless you have the turbo, the sources I found put them just about even. some site called 0-60 times even had the 6 as quicker (7.5 vs. 7.7). Some cars just feel (or sound) quicker for some reason.

of course, up to you to keep/buy whatever you like best. just trying to get the empirical data on this question!

Our very own edmunds reported this for the 2012 model: In performance testing, a loaded Optima EX in SULEV form went from zero to 60 mph in 8.9 seconds

For the 2015 6: In Edmunds testing, an automatic-equipped Mazda 6 sprinted to 60 mph in 7.6 seconds, which is a quick time for a midsize sedan with a base four-cylinder engine"
ab348,Sep-14,I find it hard to believe that a 1.x difference in 0-60 times in favor of the Mazda would be wrongly perceived as it being slower. I have read several other reviews of the 6 where it is also felt to be slow. Is it a fast car that just feels slow? I do not know. It would seem an odd thing to design into a car.
explorerx4,Sep-14,"Since so many here seem to be obsessed with 0 to 60 times, here you go:

zeroto60times.com/"
stickguy,Sep-14,"that is the site I found #s at.

and yes, I think that many cars feel quicker or slower than they really are. Plus, 0-60 is kind of meaningless, in that few people ever do that (and not a ""drag race"" start like magazines tend to do). 30-70, etc. are much more real world IMO.

but, I have always thought from what I read that the 6 was reasonably spritely, certainly for a mid size, base engine sedan. Runs with the Accord too. Is it the fastest? maybe not. Is it dangerously slow? I certainly doubt it."

brian125,Sep-14,"I was a passenger in a new 2014 Altima SL- v-6. very nice ride with plenty of head and leg room. The 3.5 motor was refined and felt fast. Road noise was muted nicely at 75 mph. Seems the review from Edmunds / Kbb on the 2015 model are still stellar for this model. I'm going to test drive one next month with a friend who wants a 2015 Altima. I will make comments on it after the test drive. Below is the review / closing thoughts on the Altima from Edmunds.

The 2015 Nissan Altima continues to be a top choice among family sedans, delivering excellent fuel economy and a rare blend of comfort and agility.

Pros

Impressive acceleration and fuel economy with either engine; strong crash test scores; satisfying ride and handling balance; capable and user-friendly electronics; above-average cabin quality.


Cons

Relatively modest rear headroom and legroom; four-cylinder engine can be noisy.


Driving Impressions

The 2015 Altima is one of the most rewarding family sedans to drive. The four-cylinder engine provides good power for passing and merging, which is particularly laudable given its exceptional fuel economy. The CVT does leave room for improvement when matched to the inline-4 -- we've found it too eager at times during moderate acceleration, causing needless engine noise, only to settle into a cruise at an rpm that feels too low -- but on the bright side, its gearless operation means you'll never feel a shift. The V6 powertrain, meanwhile, is one of the most capable in this class, and the CVT draws less attention to itself with the bigger engine.

In real-world driving, it's the Altima's well-roundedness that stands out. The ride is hushed and compliant, even on rough surfaces, but there's a sense of control that you don't get in some similarly smooth-riding competitors. Should you find yourself alone on a winding road, the precise steering and well-tuned suspension will quickly make themselves known. The Altima isn't the sportiest family sedan, nor the most luxurious, but if you're looking for both traits in the same package, it's hard to think of a competitor that does it better."
wayne21,Sep-14,"@Brian125 - one thing you may want to look for is the airbag light for the passenger seat. This seems to have been an issue for the Altima for a very long time and from reading the Nissan forums it appears that it continues to be an issue for them. People who have had the recall ""fixed"" continue to have the problem. If you plan to have a small passenger (spouse, etc) in the passenger this should be of concern to you. We won't rent an Altima anymore as our experience has been that the airbag light for my wife is constantly going off and we have to stop the car, let her get out, then reenter the car. Had this not been an issue, we would now own a 3.5 SL Altima. I think it is one of the best midsize sedans on the market. Plenty of power and by far the nicest interior."
brian125,Sep-14,"@wayne21,

‌ Thanks. My friend had asked the dealers about the 2015 models OCS software update and was told the problem was corrected . A problem with a airbag/ sensor is scary. Could you imagine that bag deploying when it shouldn't or worse not deploying at all.


Nissan claims to be correcting this problem with its recall on the Altima, Leaf and a few others.

I will have my friend look into this matter further . I'm sure if this problem isn't resolved or many cases with complaints are still out there he might want to buy something else.

WASHINGTON — Nissan North America is recalling 989,701 2013-'14 vehicles, including the Nissan Leaf and Altima, because the front passenger seat airbag may not deploy, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

Other vehicles involved in the recall include the 2013-'14 Nissan Pathfinder and Sentra, 2013 Nissan NV200 and Infiniti JX35, and 2014 Infiniti Q50 and QX60.

""In the affected vehicles, the occupant classification system or OCS software may incorrectly classify the passenger seat as empty, when it is occupied by an adult,"" said NHTSA in its summary of the problem. ""If the OCS does not detect an adult occupant in the passenger seat, the passenger airbag would be deactivated.

This recall started in May, 2014"

Man it's that center stack. I hate it. It has low resolution displays, some annoying features, and way too much fake stain alumi-plasti that you can dig chunks out with your fingernail.The good points...BIG interior. Also, It's very comfy, but I like leather AND heated seats. The heck with the SAT radio and the nav (every device has navigation) so in dash nav for $2000 is just a rip off.

So- no heated or leather seats = no sale on the Accord Sport. Also, my best friend drove the Mazda on a closed new road. The Mazda was fast off the line, but by 50 I had passed him and by 80 he was a distant memory in my rear view mirror. I really do have a very light car and I cheated by using PUG and Octane 108 down the pipe.

I gotta tell you, after spending 24 hours in the Mazda, it was ice to return to my comfy Optima.

Lastly...and most importantly. traction and stability control can be 80% shut off, but that 20% allows me to toss the car into decreasing radius on ramps and just floor it,,,, with no worry at all. It SEEMS like ""oh no were all gonna die"", but the tires never howled and the car just destroyed the 6 by those increased speeds on ramps, curves and turns.

I am keeping my car for another year. Then...maybe a car I like will become affordable. Like an Audi A3 2.0 or some sort of 6 cylinder BMW. Even a GTI is a contender. However, I would be happier with a Mazda 6 turbo. Gosh Mazda, would it kill ya to give me 220 HP??? That would be PERFECT."

While fooling around and a friend, who chased me mildly in they Mazda 6 Touring I killed off the traction on a decreasing radius on/off ramp. I took a risk and released the limited slip diff and brake distribution by 75% allowing the/ 25% to do all the work. It worked GREAT.

[Deleted User],Sep-14,"I would like to extrapolate on my last comment. My friend Jeff drove the 2014 6 and I took my car. I disabled traction and stability control. It cannot be completely turned off, but can be reduced to 25%. We got on 495 and exited at Springfield.. SInce the interchange updates, that section isn't used hardly at all, and there is nowhere for cops to hide..

Ok, so he is right on my tail until I killed off the safety nannie's, knowing how steep, uneven, and has a high rate of decreasing radius. Anyway, I just floored it. It felt like it was going to slide right out from under me, but stayed in n line..just barely...like I was Mario Andretti....not some hack...which is what I am.

Well, Jeff didn't know how to turn off anything on the Mazda...which is good because he wasn't authorized to drive it. I slaughtered him. I was at least 3 car lengths ahead before we both had to cool it art the exit. At the next light...traffic was light. It was drizzling by then, so I turned the tec back on. It was an even race, but still my car had a power advantage. Sorry guys...the Mazda 6 is great to drive, but I will NOT buy one unless it has 220 HP or more. It's chassis can handle it, a turbo will fit under the hood, and I STRONGLY believe there will be a Mazdaspeed6 version on the books as we speak.

m6user,Sep-14,"Re: Mazda performance test?

Driving one's personal car which all the driving characteristics are known and comparing it to a buddy driving a car that he has never driven before and one that he isn't even supposed to be driving is hardly any kind of ""test"". Of course, you would drive your car faster and to it's limits.

0-60 website lists the midsize cars as follows. Some are not for the current model year as they get their data from variable sources. Found results for some of the latest years but most of the times I'm listing are for years that are pretty comparable engine/weight wise. All auto trans too.

Altima 7.3
Accord 7.5
Mazda6 7.5
Optima 7.7
Sonata 7.7
Passat 7.8
Malibu 7.8
Fusion 1.6 ecoboost 7.9
Camry 8.7
Legacy 8.7

Doesn't appear the Mazda6 is slow in this group at all. By the way, it weighs about 3,200 lbs. not 2300. A few pounds less than the Optima and the Mazda6 actually has more torque that kicks in at a much lower RPM which usually helps in off the line and 0-60 times when dealing with similar weight. From what I've read the Mazdas jump up through the gears pretty quickly to get to MPG sweetspot. This probably is one of the reasons it gets class leading MPG. Unless it is really floored it probably won't give the best times and somebody new at driving it and being a little bit careful would certainly not get it's best performance.

I just wouldn't use a test like this to ""prove"" it needs more horsepower. It's pretty much right in the 170-190 area that every car in this pack is in and weighs right there as well. It does need an option for people that want to go fast. That will probably come in the form of a Mazdaspeed version in both the 3 and the 6 models.......someday????"

The Mazda 6 motor needs more low end torque. That's why it feels slow. Both Accord and Mazda 6 4cyl. are very close in H/p. A test drive is what sets these two apart realizing the 6 lacks in the zoom dept.

Car and driver had this to say about the 6 on the 2014 review which I agree.


I found the 2.5-liter inline-four more thrifty than thrilling.
I found the 2.5-liter inline-four, rated at 184 horsepower and 185 pound-feet of torque, more thrifty than thrilling. With just one soul on board, the excellent six-speed automatic moves the sedan with ease. However, when more passengers and luggage are added, the four-cylinder quickly becomes overburdened, especially on a hot day or when altitude gets added to the mix. Pulling into fast-moving traffic and overtaking maneuvers requires planning. During a family trip over a high mountain range, the Mazda6 didn't have enough scoot to safely pass a heavy truck – I was left crawling up the hill wishing for a small turbocharger or an extra liter of displacement (or, better yet, the upcoming diesel with about 300 pound-feet of torque).

When we test drove the Mazda 6 there was 3 people in car including the salesman. This vehicle was zoom less. I think this motor needs more low end torque or option a bigger motor. We were not impressed with the motor either. . I mentioned it 3 or 4 times this past year.

@cski who test drive and bought car home and had it a couple of days realized the same thing .

Most street cars love low end torque. Road racers like mid torque and top end HP.
Drag racers need high RPM HP.


The legacy also needs a engine boost / upgrade."
[Deleted User],Sep-14,"I get 19 mpg. Sucks any way I look at it. However, I have the habit of winding out the engine during light or non-existent traffic, sometimes reaching speeds that...well, are incriminating.

I have one already beat. The last one is a doozy. 67 in a 35. It is a road I drive 3 to 4 times a day. I have never had a ticket on that road.

The Mazda 6 handled and conducted itself with upscale dignity, but it wasn't so much more fun to drive than my car. I think a set of medium-stiff front struts would solve almost all the issues with my car. I assume that Hyundai/Kia used the least expensive suspension bits that met their specifications. I want new struts and a strut tower bar. I think these minor parts will play a large part in fixing the handling issues. I don't know about you guys, but my car feels too heavy in the front for the struts installed., It bobs up and down like a n 87 LeSabre (a darn fine looking car IMO). I don't want to get into american-versus asian argument, just want a good deal on new struts. I just want to have a good handling car!!!!

stickguy,Sep-14,"well, I am in the same boat with my Volvo. At 107K and with a strut apparently blown, the normally stiff ride is like a buckboard. If I decide to keep the car around, it will get new struts, and in this case, I think it will make a light years amount of difference. Really will drive like a new car.

I forget which ones I spec'ed out from tirerack, but definitely higher end than OEM. Not anything track ready or adjustable though.

I do know that they are more than $150/pop, when you factor in installation (Though if you are ambitious, can try that yourself. I am not).

Please explain what you mean by the ""6 needs more low end torque"". The Accord has 181 ft lbs at 3900 rpm and the 6 has 185 ft lbs at 3250 rpm. The 6 weighs just a little less than the Accord and has the same 0-60 speed as the Accord CVT. The Accord times you posted were for the stick and I was referring strictly to the auto trans. The auto/cvt times were virtually identical. Like I said, the gearing may be a little taller, which translates into better MPG than the Accord, which may make it feel a little different in the seat of the pants but I fail to see where the Accord has more low end torque.

Bottom line, in a family sedan, I'll take 2-3 better MPG than a .1 or .2 second faster to 60 any day of the week. If I want to race around cloverleafs and drag someone at a stoplight(really, how old are we??) I would be buying a Mustang GT or something."

You need to test drive the Mazda6 before making any comments on how the motor handles especially with a family of 4. Outside of your charts O to 60 times your pulling online you have no clue what others / I'm talking about with this motor. . Go test drive this vehicle then comment.. The mazda6 motor would benefit with more low end torque. This would give this motor some more punch at lower speeds. Did you read the review I posted from car and driver? Or mine?

If you want to race buy a mustang? I said nothing about racing. Nor did I say the 0 to 60 times were incorrect.. I said nothing about Accord torque compare to Mazda. You are implying this. If you want to compare family sedans and be objective test drive some of these models before commenting..

When you drive a cvt Accord you did not have this problem.. The Mazda would feel more adequate if it had more low end torque .

Please go test drive the 6. Then drive the Accord or Altima for that matter. You will see and feel the difference in motors. The mazda6 has the best handling of all the midsize cars. Road noise has gotten better inside the cabin."

Did I say I didn't drive the 6?   Assume much do we?  Just because I don't agree with you there is no need to be insulting. I've tested the 6 twice and once was for half a day while my Mazda6 was being worked on.  Probably longer than your test drive but I don't know so I won't make accusations.  So before you assume wrongly........just ask.  And just because I reference specs doesn't mean I don't have practical experience.    
I read what C&D said but I don't consider them to be the gods of all test drives.  Many other pubs and blogs have found the 6 to be just fine.  Not fast not slow.  Maybe it's because Mazda likes to throw around the ""zoom-zoom"" stuff  that some reviewers think it should be faster because it's marketed that way.  But with 0-60 times in the top third of mid-size family sedans and leading MPG I fail to see what all the complaining is about."

I have driven that road for 30 years, and have NEVER had a ticket. I was COASTING.

The other one was in a school zone, but I made some phone calls about what time the wig-wam (flashing yellow sign) was activated and what time the kids get out. Well, it is automated. No human hands touch it or control it. It is programmed when installed./

So, it ""activated"" like a damn*d Star Trek Probe or a Borg drone at 2:45, but the kids are not released until 3:00 PM. So, I was written a ticket doing a legal speed in a school zone where no kids were present.

I think 5 minutes is adequate to warn folks that kids will be released at 3PM, and also the sign needs to be more visible as it is located where I turn to go to to the main road and is parallel with my car. There should be a sign visible to people stopped at the light on my main thruway on Carleigh Parkway.

The last ticket...I was straight busted. However, there was a cafe-style hot road motorcycle on the other side of the truck I was passing. He was doing well over 90.

Check out the Passport 9500 xi radar detector. Great investment for $475. Best radar system on the market . GPS and Satellite driven with red light camera and speed trap notification

Whats awesome is that the 9500ix couples radar detection with GPS, using the precise location of alerts to automatically learn false alarms in your area – and then ignore them. After passing the same signal three times, the unit beeps and briefly displays “Stored” and from then on, it ignores alerts at that location. Because it is analyzing the frequency of the radar signal, it will still alert if a cop happens to be radar-ing in that same spot. You can also manually mark a spot to be ignored.

My son tested this radar system with his NYPD buddies at work. His bottom line was its a great unit with plenty of notification time on all radar. POP radar is the hardest one to detect cause cops turn this on and off. The passport did very well with pop.

I bought 2 passport units for my vehicles and its laughable that I have never been stop yet.
NY to Boston where my daughter lives............ and Myrtle beach.




I have driven from NY to S.C. Myrtle beach often. Cops everywhere. When I first bought this unit 6 years ago I made my boy drive with me a couple of times to Myrtle beach to test it out fearing of getting a ticket.

Mazda6 owners seem to like their cars. It had the highest owner satisfaction of any mid-sized car in Consumer Reports' most recent Car Owner Satisfaction Survey:
http://consumerreports.org/cro/2012/12/owner-satisfaction/index.htm

They may be satisfied and happy in their new admittedly great handling car until they get blown away by a Fusion, Kia, and especially it's nemesis, the Accord.
Like I said, after 2 test drives. 185 hp = no sale. Why would I trade my car for a slower one?"
stickguy,Sep-14,"well, you would save on speeding tickets for one thing!"
akirby,Sep-14,Why are you so obsessed over a few hp in a midsized family sedan?
m6user,Sep-14,"Mazda6 - 185 hp
Accord - 185 hp
Altima - 182 hp
Camry - 173 hp
Legacy - 175 hp
Sonata - 190 hp
Passat - `170 hp
Fusion - 175 hp
Optima - 190 hp

Fusion 0-60 = 7.9 secs
Mazda6 0-60 = 7.5 secs
Optima/Sonata 0-60 7.7 secs

Yeah, looks like the Fusion really blows the doors off the Mazda6??? Seems the HP is right in the middle of the group and it's 0-60 time is in the top third. Appears that someone is exaggerating. The only Accord that ""blows away"" the Mazda6 is the stick and that is by a whole one second. And to tell the truth I have never seen a published 0-60 time for the stick Mazda6 so I have no idea how it would really do.

Bottom line: All this talk about 0-60 and drag racing is kind of silly. People don't even care how fast these cars are as long as they can get out of their own way. Anybody that cares about real speed is going to buy a car with 240hp+ at least. Talking about one 4banger blowing away another 4banger with a couple of extra horses is trash talk."
explorerx4,Sep-14,I think I've figured out something about how my Fusion measures fuel mileage. It seems to over estimate how much coasting adds to the average fuel mileage. I drive over a good size 'hill' on my normal commute. The mileage doesn't seem to drop us much after going up the hill as it goes up on the way down. The average mpg readout does seem to get more accurate the closer to empty I push the range.
nyccarguy,Sep-14,"Horsepower & Fuel Economy numbers don't ""tell as much of the story"" as they used to. A car's acceleration and fuel economy are as much determined by the transmission, how the car is geared, and of course it's weight as the car's power output.

@cski‌

I totally understand you not wanting to go for the Mazda6, especially if you feel it is an inferior vehicle (acceleration wise) and it is in the same category as your Optima.

I'm adjusting to life with my 175 horsepower Subaru Legacy quite nicely. So far (3 days into ownership), I'm impressed with the car's build quality. I can't seem to find a place where Subaru ""cheaped out."" Believe me, I'd have noticed by now. The ride is definitely comfortable and compliant without being sprung ""overly soft."" I do like the fact that it is different (even though the grill & headlights seemed to ave been ripped off a Ford Taurus). So far I've only seen 1 ""in the wild"" since I took delivery (red).

I know it has been said a few times, but there is a lot of competition in this class for a reason. Different strokes for different folks. Each car has something unique and special about it whether it be acceleration, handling, driving dynamics, comfort, a turbo motor, a diesel motor, availability of a manual transmission, AWD, interior comfort, trunk space, most features for the buck.. There is no correct answer. Just the right choice."
stickguy,Sep-14,"NYC, glad you are liking it. I figured the Legacy would be a good option for your commute. Let me know what you end up getting for real world MPG too."
ab348,Sep-14,The topic of the day is why the new 2015 Hyundai Sonata Turbo is so slow when compared to its claimed Hp as compared to its competition. This is based on results of acceleration tests conducted by all the usual magazines and websites. Aparently it is a real slug. Discuss.
stickguy,Sep-14,geared for MPG?
nyccarguy,Sep-14,"Now I have to do some more digging into the owner's manual to see how the trip computer works. Does it automatically reset after each fill up? The car had 95 miles on it when I took delivery. My salesman told me he filled the car up, so the trip computer was set at ZERO. Right now sitting in my driveway it shows the average mpg at 30. I'll see how long I can go until my 1st fill up."
backy,Oct-14,"ab348 said:

You meant the 2.0T, right? (There's also the 1.6T.) The 2015 Sonata 2.0T is down 29 HP from the prior generation, using a smaller turbo than the 2014 car. Then Hyundai re-tuned the car for better response at lower speed vs. 0-60 time.

Edmunds.com gave the 2015 Sonata 2.0T an ""A"" overall rating. As was noted above, not everyone (including me) is looking for blistering acceleration in their mid-sized family cars. There's other characteristics that are more important. (My Sonata of choice is the 1.6T Eco, and I'm sure that would be blown away on the drag strip by several other mid-sized cars.) So while the Sonata 2.0T won't win many 0-60 races against competitors, it seems to be a solid overall package in the class. In giving the Sonata 2.0T an ""A"" for ""Fun to Drive"", Edmunds.com said:

It's difficult to label the vast majority of midsize family sedans as ""fun-to-drive."" The 2015 Hyundai Sonata Sport 2.0T does an admirable job of approaching that level by remaining composed and capable through curves. Power may be down versus V6 rivals, but it feels faster than it is.

http://www.edmunds.com/hyundai/sonata/2015/rating-details.html?sub=sedan

Consider: why has the Miata been so popular over the years? Because of its power and 0-60 times? No. It has other attributes that are appealing to buyers looking for a fun-to-drive convertible. Just as the Sonata 2.0T has attributes appealing to buyers of mid-sized family sedans. For buyers like you, there's quicker cars to choose from."
stickguy,Oct-14,"I saw the 200 at the auto show, and it was a huge improvement style wise. Have not sat in or driven one.

IMO, the mid-size class right now is full of great options. Even the ""bottom feeder"" cars are quite nice, and loaded with goodies for an attractive price. The competition is fierce, which is great for buyers. Really hard to go wrong with any option.

so, as always, each model has it's own unique personality and plusses/minuses. So buyers just need to figure out which one pushes their buttons the best. I love the new Legacy for a number or reasons, but know that some others will not like it at all. I also looked at a Camry expecting to hate it, and turned out to really like it, and came close to leasing one (still might if I manage to sell my other cars!)

On the upper model S, awd 30k version there is a rotary shifter. A big knob in the center stack which is a nice touch. Jaguar vehicles also have the rotary shifter. Right next to the shifter was a parking brake button you push to secure brake. The alpine stereo sounded good and the info center was nice. Interior room not as big as Accord , Altima , or Fusion.

Its called E-loop. Funny thing about e-loop if you look at Mazda's mpg numbers posted by owners the past 2 years with and without e-loop you will see the real mpg's. Not many are getting close to 36 highway. Why is that? Isn't Mazda's pck. increaser suppose to get you 40 mpg/ 38 non e-loop

Don't believe everything you read from Car Companies. EPA and real world MPG's are 2 different tales.

So to echo your last line . A little research goes a long way and adds to one credibility."

My RDX has averaged over 25 mpg over the last 3000 miles.  It's supposed to get 22 avg.  Would I use 25 for comparison.......no.  That's just my experience.  But I think it's pretty well known that if one drives easy the EPA 's numbers are attainable."
akirby,Oct-14,"You used to be able to use your mpg compared to EPA and it would be fairly close. e.g. if you currently get 26 in your car that has a 25 mpg EPA rating, then you could reasonably expect to get 1 mpg (or the same percentage) better in another similar vehicle. However, newer drivetrains are so much more sophisticated and much more variable that it's hard to do that. Especially smaller turbos like Ford's ecoboosts. On my 2.0L EB Fusion titanium I can get anywhere from 17 to 28 on my 12 mile daily commute depending on how much traffic there is and how often I have to stop. You really have to drive carefully to get the EPA mpgs in some cases. You also have to factor in ethanol content. EPA testing is done with 100% gasoline while most everyone gets E-10 at the pump nowadays and that will cost you 1-2 mpg.

Also remember that in the old days of 12-18 mpg vehicles a 15% difference was only a couple of miles per gallon - hardly noticeable. Nowadays a 15% difference could be 4-6 mpg.

And the actual difference in fuel usage is much less. e.g. driving 300 miles per week and going from 12 mpg to 15 mpg saves 5 gallons per week ($15-$20). Going from 30 to 35 only saves 1.6 gallons ($5-$6).

And don't forget - the EPA fuel economy testing really has nothing whatsoever to do with generating the window stickers - it's done for CAFE compliance and the numbers that are used for that are not what goes on the window sticker. The window sticker mpg is an afterthought created from the CAFE tests plus other tests and mathematical formulas.

As such there is no such thing as a ""real world"" number. Everybody will get different results because there are far too many variables."
brian125,Oct-14,"@akirby
Excellent point about the ethanol testing . They should start testing new vehicle's with E-10.
Some vehicle can't meet EPA testing some will meet/ exceed.

In the wake of the revelations that Hyundai's and Kia's EPA mileage ratings were overstated, got sued and lost its case it's more important than ever for consumers to understand that mileage ratings are not always what they seem. last year Ford's c-max model was overstated by 5/6 mpg's.

On every new-car window sticker, shoppers will see in the same fine print: ""Actual results will vary for many reasons, including driving conditions and how you drive and maintain your vehicle."" Mazda6's fine print says the MPG's numbers are achievable at 45% city and 55 hwy.

That makes it sound like your gas mileage is solely your fault, and often, it is. But there's at least one other factor: The particular version of the car you buy and the features that come with it will affect the mileage of your new car no matter how passively you drive it.

Last time I read up on gas testing and I'm no expert here. Automakers determine gas-mileage ratings based on tailpipe-emissions tests, The EPA has admitted it audits only about 15% of automakers' claims for accuracy. Not every variation of every car model is tested by automakers. You could easily wind up with a version that gets significantly worse mileage than what its Monroney sticker claims. Those claims take into account the engine, transmission and drivetrain, but there are many more variables.

How about sport trim levels, gigantic sunroofs, larger wheels, different seating configurations in large crossovers, optional storage panels ... you name it. They can all affect your gas mileage.

@m6user if you drive like the manufacture has posted you should come close to that EPA number and a lot of times you will. I looked at over 40 vehicles posted mpg numbers From folks driven there 2014 / 15 Mazda6. Owners that drove at 45/55 city / hwy did not get close to that 38 or 40 mpg number nor did the drivers that drove 70hwy/ 30 city. The I-eloop is a very ingenious concept that probably adds some MPG but the big picture tells a different mpg story."
stickguy,Oct-14,"Number on sticker is results from a very specific EPA test scenario. That pretty much no one actually comes close to replicating. Which is why real world varies so much. Anyone that complains, first make sure they doubt exceed 62 or so on the highway. Guaranteed that will help!

And city is not downtown NYC or LA. More like small town mixed I think. So toss out extended stop and go!"
stickguy,Oct-14,"Also, some cars by design are going to miss by more, since they are basically set up to run the test, not function in the real world."
akirby,Oct-14,"They actually capture and measure the carbon waste from the tailpipe and that tells them how much fuel was burned.

There are specific rules on which options are included. They don't include options if the take rate is too low - 19"" or 20"" wheels, expensive heavy moonroofs, etc. That's why you sometimes see strange combinations of features - the mfr is trying to limit the sales of certain options so they don't have to be included.

They also use formulas to simulate certain things which is where Ford and Hyundai got into trouble because their formula was wrong. At least Ford found their mistake and self-corrected it.

In the end, there is too much variability in the real world with the same vehicle being driven in different climates and traffic conditions by different people to come up with a single number. And if you put the true range on the window sticker it would be so wide (15-25 mpg e.g.) that it's useless. There is no good answer."
m6user,Oct-14,"I think a lot of people that drive in very heavy stop and go traffic or they jackrabbit drive can't get the EPA avg.  They complain about how unreasonable the EPA numbers are.   IMO most people that drive fairly conservative and aren't in major metro type traffic don't have a  problem reaching them.

akirby,Oct-14,Short trips are terrible. With new emission regs they have to run them rich to light off the cats and warm them up quickly. They haven't actually changed the way they measure fuel economy for CAFE - just what gets reported on the window sticker because people can't stop complaining about it if they come up short. Maybe they should just put 8 mpg on everything and people will be ecstatic they beat the window sticker!
ivan_99,Oct-14,"Mileage...

You're not supposed to achieve their numbers...they are just pretend numbers.

The EPA mileage numbers are just used to compare against other vehicles."
suydam,Oct-14,For pretend numbers they're pretty accurate. Magic?
ahightower,Oct-14,"Recently did about 500 miles round trip NW DFW to Houston and back. AC on, speed limit varied from 65 - 75. Going down (in a hurry) running about 83 mph, did 29.5 mpg. Headed home more relaxed pace, 2-3 above the posted limit, 31.9 mpg. This according to the trip computer, which I've found to be off by as much as 0.8 versus manual calculations. Rated 24/34/27, so I guess it's not bad considering the speeds.

I didn't use ECO mode on the trip, I just prefer the more responsive throttle and stronger AC in normal. But, I got a warning (39 in a 30, which really should be a 45 but I digress) from a friendly officer yesterday, and decided to drive like a grandpa in ECO mode for a while, both to slow myself down and to see what the car is really capable of in my daily 50/50 commute. I have noticed that, in ECO mode, the cruise control will not apply as much throttle to maintain speed on inclines. Which is a nuisance to other drivers, but the instant mpg indicator doesn't dip near as much.

I fully expect to be bored with this test shortly, and to run the numbers at next fill-up and realize I've saved no more than $1 per tank versus my usual ""safe-but-spirited"" driving style. But I'll let it go for a week or two if I can stand it, just to see."
ivan_99,Oct-14,"suydam said:

I think so

When you 'guess' how much gas is used by analyzing the exhaust...and then have the results actually come close to real-world is pretty magical.

That's why the EPA gives a range. You're not ""supposed"" to get their listed mileage, you're supposed to compare their listed mileage to another vehicle they ran the identical test on."
akirby,Oct-14,"They're not ""guessing"" based on exhaust analysis. They actually *measure* the exhaust by products and scientifically calculate how much gasoline was actually burned inside the engine which is much more accurate than liquid measures."

Civic is surprisingly decent for leg room, but the limited head room with mandatory sun roof was just not doable. Plus they're not really necessary in this part of TX- it's usually too hot. My wife loves them, it was one of her few requirements for her new vehicle. Fortunately the Pathfinder has a LOT of head room even with the sunroof. And the kids love the rear sunroof (doesn't open, just glass, has a totally opaque screen that slides and they like it open as often as possible). The little wind blocker on the front sunroof does make it very useable even at freeway speed. So for about 6 weeks a year when it's neither too hot nor too cold, we will enjoy it.

suydam,Oct-14,"Sunroof is a requirement for me. As I get older my list of ""must haves"" gets longer and longer!"
fushigi,Oct-14,"Not midsize sedans but here's my fuel economy experience.

On fuel economy, my '10 AWD V6 crossover is rated 17/20/24. I typically average 19/21/24. Lifetime average is 21.01 (I've tracked every expense & fill-up). Worst mileage for a tank was 13MPG during February's deep freeze with nothing but short (sub-2 mile) trips. Best was, strangely, this past summer fully loaded with 7 passengers (5 adults/2 kids) & AC on for a highway road trip to a zoo where it got 28.5.

But fuel economy is a secondary or even tertiary concern. When my 5 years of ownership hits in December I'll have 41K miles on the odo. At a hair over 8K a year I simply don't drive enough for gas to be a significant expense.

My wife's '12 Elantra does poorly in city driving (around 19MPG) but she also does nothing but very short trips and favors a stronger off the line push. It easily gets 38-40 highway @ 70MPH with AC on so EPA numbers are there despite the Hyundai misreporting issue. She averages about 8500 miles/year.

My sister bought a '13 Elantra MT; her commute is about 120 miles round trip. She reports getting about 45MPG highway which includes dealing with Indy's rush hour traffic."
backy,Oct-14,"I find the biggest discrepancies between real-world FE and EPA FE is in city driving. As with your experience, I can easily exceed EPA FE numbers on highway trips, and even in my around-town driving. But my around-town driving is different from the around-town driving of many other people, including my wife's. I don't drive that much during rush hours, I don't let my car sit idling for long stretches (e.g. if I'm waiting for someone), I use a light foot on the gas, I anticipate stops when practical etc. She doesn't do any of those things, and her trips tend to be shorter than mine with less freeway driving. So while she struggles to hit the EPA city number on her 2013 Sonata, I exceed it.

But a highway trip with no stops is pretty easy to compare to other highway trips, weather and terrain being equal. But those vary a lot too. I drive in the Midwest with no mountains, and with large variations in temperature, from -25 F to 100 F. My FE suffers a lot in cold winter weather. In temperate weather, at 70 mph or below on the highway, I have no problem exceeding EPA numbers, like your sister with her Elantra.

On another topic re mid-sizers... I took my Mazda6i hatchback in today for an oil change, and while I was waiting sat in a base Mazda6i with no options except pearl white paint. I don't know why people complain about the quality of interior materials on that car. I thought they were quite good. Nicely padded and grained dash, cushy armrests, padded/upholstered door panels, smooth HVAC rotary controls, leather covered wheel, cloth headliner, solid-feeling vents, etc. The dash and center console have a simple design, and maybe some people equate that with ""cheap"". I think it's ergonomic, even Germanic in appearance. I prefer it over the interior of cars like the Accord LX, Camry LE, and Altima S."

brian125,Oct-14,"CVT's Insight,

Rather than sets of gears, CVTs use a belt that runs between two variable-diameter pulleys to give a wide range of ratios and a smooth transition between them. Some CVTs use a fluid-filled torque converter (as with a conventional automatic) to transfer power from the engine to the transmission, others a clutch similar to that used for a manual transmission, but with automatic activation (there is no clutch pedal).

The advantage of a CVT is that the engine can be kept at its most efficient speed while the transmission adjusts to changes in load or road speed. Under brisk acceleration, for example, the engine revs up to where it produces the most power and is held there as the transmission constantly adjusts to the increasing speed of the car. Under cruise conditions, the transmission can adjust for small changes in road speed while the engine is kept at a consistent rpm for best fuel economy. A limiting factor is that because CVTs rely on friction between the belt and the pulleys, they haven’t yet been designed to handle a lot of power. Currently, the highest-horsepower CVT application is in the Nissan Maxima, where it’s paired with a 290-horsepower 3.5-liter V6."

If you want something with a non-CVT AT and proven, the Camry may be your best bet.

From what I've read about the new Sonata, it's a very comfortable, quiet mid-sizer, and the 2.4L with 6AT has been around awhile."

I think all car companies should adopt a warranty program like these 2 companies. Stand behind your product bumper to bumper for atleast 5 years and 10yr on powertrain. This is one good reason 2 buy either a Kia or Hyundai. . The other is both are making much better vehicles today."
backy,Oct-14,"My 2001 Elantra, purchased new 14 years ago, is still running strong and the interior looks like new (exterior has some wear and tear), owned now by my sister. My 2004 Elantra, purchased new 10-1/2 years ago, still runs like new and interior and paint are in great shape--but also a few dings and scratches. Owned now by my son. Both cars have been very reliable during their lifetimes. I currently lease a 2013 Sonata (2 years old) and a 2013 Rio5, and except for one recall on the Sonata no problems on either car. I think if you check, you'll see Toyota's had a few recalls over the past few years too.

If you want a Camry, get a Camry. I'm sure you'll get good service out of it. But if I were to buy a car to be driven for over 10 years, I'd check out all my options. As was said, there's a lot of great choices in this field now.

Footnote: anecdotal evidence aside, the prior-generation Sonata was one of CR's favorites in this class. They don't recommend unreliable cars. The powertrain on the 2015 (2.4L, 6AT) is a retuned version of the 2.4L powertrain from the 2011-14 Sonata. And the 2010 Sonata was JD Power's winner of their 2013 VDS. Not Camry or Accord. Toyota and Honda aren't the only choices for reliable cars these days."
brian125,Oct-14,"Hyundai Sonata and Toyota Camry are redesigned for 2015, as are the Chrysler 200 and Subaru legacy. All of these models boast enhanced suspensions for better handling, as well as better interior materials. The legacy has a 6cyl. option if you want to avoid the CVT model version.

Competition this year will be fierce in the midsize market. Incentives and rebates will be flying around making it a very good 2015 for many buyers.

How many Hyundais have you owned, or had in your family? Had any for over 10 years? How about 14 years?

I owned a Sonata from the 2006-10 generation and the steering was fine. Not the crispest handling mid-sizer by any means, but safe handling and a smooth ride. CR recommends the 2007-08 Sonata as one of their best bets in a used sedan--those are now 7-8 years old so they must hold up pretty well. Up until now the Sonata never had great chassis dynamics, but both the 2006-10 and 2011-14 Sonatas were at least as capable as the Camry there. The 2015 is improved there according to reviews; Edmunds gave it their top score in ""fun to drive"".

Your comment about those who demand more is unintentionally funny, considering the OP is favoring buying a Camry. Not exactly the car I think about for someone who demands more out of mid-sized car, except for reliability.

The big thing for me with the extra-length powertrain warranties is the transmission. Engines don't fail much anymore, but we all know of recalls and problems with modern automatics. So it's nice to know that slushboxes, very expensive to fix/replace, are covered up to 10 years/100k miles for the original owner, or later owner if a CPO car."
stickguy,Oct-14,"based on the components that the powertrain piece covers, I think of it as transmission protection. Because that is the massively expensive component covered that actually sometimes fails in that time period. Most everything else (engine internals) is probably going to be fine. Certainly nice to have if you do get a premature failure of course.

Though there is a LT poster here (haven't seen him in a while) that did have an early engine failure in a Hyundai and get screwed over by Hyundai refusing to cover it, on trumped up charges.

also, in terms of cost, Hyunkia is self insuring. So, it costs them nothing up front, just whatever claims they actually cover 5+ years down the road. And that is only for original owners, since that extended period (the up to 10/100) doesn't transfer.

so they must be budgeting something into the price of the car for this coverage, but I doubt the price would drop much if they gave it up."

You may be pleased to know that CR has ranked the new Legacy its top mid-sized sedan, with Camry, Accord, and (!) Malibu also scoring highly. They also like the Passat 1.8T.

Kinda a weird commentary, I think, given styling is subjective and I wouldn't call cars like the Legacy, Accord, and Malibu ""adventurous"" in their styling. Also, they tested only the 2.4L version of the Sonata, while they tested multiple powertrains on most other mid-sizers.

They really slammed the new 200 though. It got a little higher score than the old 200, but they didn't find much to like about it."

Interesting. The Canadian car site autos.ca did a comparo this week of the Subaru and 200, both AWD, and thought the 200 was the choice.

Less interesting looking than the Mazda6 for sure. Less interesting looking than cars like the Legacy, Accord, Passat, Malibu, Altima, Camry? I don't think so. The 2.0T Sport is less quick than the 2014 car, but is it quick enough for 95% of mid-sized sedan buyers? Some people seem to overlook the improvements for 2015 in FE (especially with the 1.6T Eco), interior room, quietness, ergonomics, safety, convenience, ride & handling, and engine tractability. Edmunds.com didn't overlook these things in rating the Sonata ""A"" overall.

Toyota has sold lots of Camrys to buyers looking for a solid, quiet, roomy, smooth-riding mid-sized car. ""Boring"" wasn't an issue there."

I agree. After seeing the new Sonata on the road, it doesn't look bad at all. It is a little more blocky...basically the same look as the Subaru Legacy. Apparently the smaller turbo and reduced output improve drivability and in the end will be more reliable with less stress on the motor.

In other news, I have been sick with Pneumonia, and as a bonus I am passing a kidney stone. No fun at all. The pain is unbelievable.

As far as fuel economy goes, I changed my driving style. I no longer dig deep on the gas pedal, and in general I stick to not more than 7 mph over the speed limit, and I use the cruise control constantly. I am amazed at how much better my F/E has been. I am at 23.8 mpg. That is right on the 24 mpg city that is on the Monroney sticker. So, the problem was not so much the congestion.... the problem was the driver.

Response-

My A/C died on my Optima that is 3 year old and has 30k on the odometer. They refilled it and added dye to make sure they can track a leak at my next oil change. The oil change and the A/C service are free of charge. They also replaced my battery when it failed the charge test, also free of charge. I bought the extended b2b warranty for 10 years 100k. I know some of you don't believe in them, but I think it was $900 well spent even if it is just for POM. Ryster, I wonder if it is just your dealer nickel and dining you. I know a neighbor with a 2012 Sonata and he uses the Hyundai Store that also owns my Kia store. He has not paid for any repair either."
akirby,Nov-14,I never understood Peace of Mind on extended warranty purchases. To me you're spending $1K-$2K up front for something you may never need and even if you do need it won't kick in for at least 3-5 years. I've driven my last 5 vehicles for 2-3 years past the factory B2B warranty and I've spent a grand total of $60 for a door handle and $150 for a cooling fan. By not buying an extended warranty on those vehicles I've saved at least $7000. Even if I had to pay for a new engine tomorrow I'm still thousands ahead. To me that's peace of mind.
ahightower,Nov-14,"akirby said:

I typically agree, and yet... when I was closing on my 2013 Accord, they made such a strong offer on the b2b extended warranty that I went for it. It was the first year of a redesigned model, which was my only hesitation about the car. So this gave me peace of mind that at least there would be no repair costs while I was still making payments. And they included five oil changes, which I usually like to do by myself, but what the hey. When all was said and done, they had actually cut the price of the car (below what I was already satisfied with), and the interest rate (from 0.9 to 0.4) in order to charge more for the warranty. Bit of a shell game, but my total out-of-pocket was satisfactory."
akirby,Nov-14,I'll amend my statement that it can make sense if you finance the warranty so you're only paying a few dollars per month to avoid making a single large repair payment especially if you're on fixed or low income.
stickguy,Nov-14,Insurance only makes sense for cost certainty or catastrophe.
akirby,Nov-14,Some people don't understand that warranties are simply insurance policies. Self insuring is always cheaper over the long run if you can afford it.
stevedebi,Nov-14,"akirby said:

I've had the opposite experience. I got one on our 2001 Honda Civic, and it paid for itself. I also got one on my 2008 Escape Hybrid, and it paid for itself. If I plan to keep a car, I will get an extended warranty that covers at least the length of the loan - that way I don't have out of pocket beyond the payments.

For my new 2014 Cmax Energi, I am leasing for 3 years, but if I decide to buy I will get the extended warranty. There is just too much electronics on these vehicles to take the chance.

Some folks would rather take chances. I'd rather have the peace of mind. Also, whatever is not used of the warranty is refunded if I sell."
suydam,Nov-14,I figure if I'm buying a reliable car I shouldn't need anything extra. So far that has been the right choice with my vehicles.
nyccarguy,Nov-14,"The Legacy is the 1st car I've ever purchased with an extended warranty. Bumper to Bumper is 3 years/36K from the factory with 5 years/60K power train. I took a 5 year/100K Extended Warranty from Subaru (not a 3rd party) for $1,538. I drive 20,000 miles per year, so I'll blow through the factory b to b in a year & a half and the power train in 3 years. So I know if the CVT blows between 60,001 & 100,000 miles I'll be covered. The warranty also covers 4 replacement tires."
stevedebi,Nov-14,"suydam said:

It is definitely an individual decision, and reflects the philosophy of the owner!"
brian125,Nov-14,"Warranties,

I also agree if your buying a reliable model Pass on the Warranty. My cars are owned only 3 to 6 years. The money I have saved over the years not taking these extenders is overwhelming. When I was younger and my kids were pre teen to teens I keep vehicles 6 years. Remember the Dodge Caravan in the early 80's, nice ride but American garbage. Vehicles like theses' needed a warranty. My dodge with 45k needed full front end work, A trans, A/c compressor, Condenser Alternator, Electrical problems and yes many rattles and squeaks. I'm sure there were more vehicles like this back then. Not so much Now.



Consumer Reports proved by surveying 8,000 owners of five and six year-old vehicles that had been covered by extended service plans. 75% of those surveyed said they spent significantly more for the contract than they got back in repair-cost savings. Respondents said their extended warranty cost them $1,200 on average while providing an average benefit of $700. That means the average loss was $500. A big reason: almost 50 percent of extended warranties were never used, in most cases because the vehicle didn't need repairs or the standard manufacturer's warranty sufficed.

Another reason people were dissatisfied was because the repair was not covered. Clichés about reading the fine print are especially appropriate when talking about extended warranties. The brochure may present the service plan as ""comprehensive,"" but the contract will likely have numerous limitations, such as requiring documented service at in-network shops and covering only certain parts, rather than whole systems. A good Example of this is Hyundai and Kia's Limited extended warranty. Read the fine print. Still the best warranty out there for free.

Rather than invest in an extended warranty, buying the most reliable car that suits your needs, budget, and taste and taking good care of it. Sometimes, this can mean spending more upfront, but the reward is typically lower ownership costs and even better resale value. But, if you're heart is set on a model known to be unreliable, an extended warranty can provide some protection. Just approach with caution, negotiate the price, and be aware that if you roll the cost into your financing, you'll be paying interest on it for years to come."
akirby,Nov-14,"All you need to know is that the companies selling these extended warranties are making money on them (or they wouldn't be selling them). Therefore on average over a large number of vehicles they win. They price their warranties to make sure of that. It's no different than playing roulette in vegas. You might win once or twice but if you play long enough the house always wins because the odds are always in their favor.

If you want to gamble that's fine - you might win a few times. But at least recognize it's a gamble that's not in your favor.

As for not paying anything out of pocket - where do you think the cost of the warranty came from in the first place?"
stevedebi,Nov-14,"akirby said:

I only buy warranties that cover everything (except wear and tear) and with low deductibles. For Ford, that means PremiumCare zero deductible. And I normally finance the warranties, which means there is no additional out of pocket besides the initial cost folded into the loan - and if the car is wrecked, I have paid only for what I used.

A single repair of an electronics module can easily cost several hundred dollars (I know, I've had it happen, except I didn't pay - the warranty did).

As to ""roulette"", insurance is always based on the odds, based on the probable payouts. They would not be selling if the company did not think that they would be better for them over the long run. And they wouldn't sell if there were not folks like me who prefer to have one known payment and not to have to worry about covering repair costs while paying the car payments. I don't particularly care what CR says - this is the way I roll, and so far the ""roulette"" has gone my way by a big margin."
akirby,Nov-14,"Just a question - when you say it paid for itself on several vehicles - does that mean you had a repair that would not have been covered by the regular factory warranty but was covered by the extended warranty? Or just that you had a repair covered by warranty? You can't count repairs covered under the standard warranty because that's included with the vehicle at no extra cost. E.g. on a Fusion the ESP only covers the powertrain between 5 and 7 yrs and between 60K and 100K miles. Before that the factory warranty is in effect and after that you don't have a warranty at all.

And FYI - zero deductible anything is a waste of money."
backy,Nov-14,"I've bought extended warranties before on used vehicles but never on a new vehicle. One case was a disaster--a warranty on an MPV that I used once, and it worked great, saved $500 on the repair. Then the warranty company went belly-up. I got another one from a more reputable company on a 2005 Jetta, but I never used it as the Jetta was totaled a few months later so I got nearly the entire warranty cost refunded.

If I were to get an extended warranty on a used car again, my preference would be to get the extended coverage offered on CPO cars, since that's backed by the automaker. Or the ""powertrain warranty for life"" coverage offered for no charge (well, the charge is built into the price I'm sure) on used cars by well-established dealers."
[Deleted User],Nov-14,"I loved the style of my car, and the 10 year 100k warranty relieved any reliability fears.

Tell that to the guy whose house burns down. Why, if he'd saved that $1,500 a year, he could have saved enough to rebuild out of his own pocket in just a couple hundred years!

I kid. It's true, insurance is intended for uncertain catastrophes. Maintenance and care (home, auto, or health) are not ""insurance"". You don't expect your car insurance to pay for new tires, nor your homeowners insurance to pay for mowing the grass, and you shouldn't expect your health insurance to pay for... well, I'll step back from that ledge before I alienate the entire forum.

Does a buying a $750 warranty for maybe $2-3K worth of repairs, maybe $0 worth of repairs, make sense?... Not really. Which is why I declined it three times before the marginal monthly payment increase was so small I briefly lost touch with my left brain and went for it. And ya know, I'm still glad it's there. Though I have the savings on hand to handle a transmission or electrical problem, when you begin to think in terms of $15 a month, your inner Dave Ramsey gets the boot. They are very good at selling the stupid things. And don't we all upsell something in our jobs? If I couldn't talk people into bells and whistles now and then, my kids would be hungry."
Mr_Shiftright,Nov-14,"Well obviously underwriters are making money on extended warranties, so the idea that the ""house wins"" more than the car owner makes sense.

akirby,Nov-14,"Mr_Shiftright said:



Not necessarily. It just means that the calculated cost of average repairs is lower during the extended warranty period. This could be because most big ticket failures occur during the factory warranty period or the cost of the repairs is lower or the policy has more exclusions or higher deductibles.

Or they have a lower profit margin."
brian125,Nov-14,"Yes the water pump is covered.

The powertrain warranty will cover all components of a powertrain system that are submerged in fluid. So, the water pump is covered because it's submerged in fluid, but an E.G.R. valve is not likely to be covered. I know on Honda and Toyota they are not.

An important warranty that everyone should know about is the extended federal emissions warranty. This covers just a few emission components for eight years or 80,000 miles, mainly the PCM (Powertrain Control Module) and the catalytic converter, but very few people know this warranty exists and that it covers two very expensive repairs. This warranty is only good at an authorized dealership. So be sure to ask before paying for either of these repairs. I know several people who spent over 1500 dollars to Replace these parts not knowing they have 8yrs/ 80k."
stevedebi,Nov-14,"akirby said:

The repairs were after the 3/36 (or 5/50 powertrain). So the original warranty was not valid.

And FYI - I disagree with your zero deductible statement."
akirby,Nov-14,"It almost always costs more for a zero deductible warranty than you save in deductible fees. E.g if you make 2 claims with a $100 deductible you spent $200 out of pocket but you probably saved $300 up front by choosing the $100 deductible.

You'd have to make several claims on a single vehicle to recoup the up front cost difference.

styling, that is definitely different. front end is iffy, back and sides nice improvement IMO.

did not drive it, so can't comment on the reported improvements to steering and driving dynamics.

Price seems to be up slightly, but hard to compare exactly the way the shuffled standard equipment and options packages.

I think it is silly that they did that big a redesign, and the XLE still does not have basic blind spot monitoring or keyless entry/start standard. A 21K Mazda 3 has that."

The V6 XSE and XLE both have the keyless entry as standard. Those features will filter down/become standard over the 5 year model run."

stickguy,Nov-14,"picked up a 2015 Sonata limited tech today. Was looking at a 2014 Limited 2.0T leftover, but the new model blew it away. Only the 2.4 so not as fast, but still plenty quick. Loaded to the gills. Very nice driving too (handling, ride, quite, seats). I may never figure out all the features this thing has. Frugal too. even with all the idling while playing with features at delivery, and mixed driving on way home with a few stops, trip MPG showing 29.5.

can't wait to get a real highway stretch. But better watch out. This is deceptively fast. crept up to 70 on a 4 lane local road and felt like I was doing 30. Cruise on the highway will be a must.

very, very well done IMO. I sat in a 2015 Camry limited this week (did not drive) and honestly there does not seem to be any comparison in style or feature content to the Sonata.

very nice upgrade model. Highly competitive in the class I think.

only have 45 miles on it. I will post impressions once I get more time in it.

A Sonata, with heated/cooled seats up font (heated rear). Even has a heated steering wheel. What is the world coming to?"
m6user,Nov-14,"My wife is in the market for a new midsizer. Going to give the Mazda6 to our grandaughter. I would prefer a new Mazda6 but she will be driving it 98% so it is her choice. Her main want is quiet ride and dependability. The rest can be average like handling, tech, looks. She has driven our Mazda6 over 120k and virtually nothing has gone wrong but currently looking at a wheel bearing replacement which is not a big deal considering the miles. I've test driven the new Mazda6 a couple of times and I like it but to be honest it isn't much quieter than our current one so she wants to try something else.

Anywho, I've been web comparing the 2015 Sonata, Passat, Camry, Legacy and Malibu as they seem to get good reviews for the things she's looking for.....mainly solitude on the freeway. Looking for comments on specific likes and dislikes between these models if someone has done some recent comparing or test drives. I will probably be test driving all these models in the next week to boil it down to two or three for her to test drive. On paper I""m kind of liking the Sonata Eco Sport so far. And yes I've considered the others but have ruled them out for one reason or the other so I'm really looking for info on the ones I mentioned. Tks."
stickguy,Nov-14,"I'll play, having recent time in a Sonata, Legacy, passat and Camry. Sat in the malibu and it seemed nice enough, but never drove one (just the previous generation thanks to Hertz).

Passat: Had a 2012 base model rental recently and put on about 300 miles. 50K on it. overall, a nice enough drive. Huge car though (at least perception wise). Good seats. the 2.5L was kind of coarse, but that is not an issue. I have a lot of wheel time in a new Jetta with the 1.8T, and it is a nice powertrain, that gets good MPG. Downside, if you are in for a long term relationship, it is a VW. Overall, I think of this as a good highway car if you don't want overstuffed isolation.

Camry: did a couple of test drives. I liked it more than expected. On local streets it seemed to handle fine, but I never tried hustling it. Seats did feel good, and as typical for a Camry, it was serene. I sat in a new style 2015 (no drive). interior seemed very similar. Reportedly the steering/handling dynamics have been improved. Seems to lag on features unless you really blow the budget.

Legacy: Maybe NYC will wander by (since he just bought one) but from his reports, his has been a fine commuter car on the highway. I test drove a couple of times, and thought it was a very nice package. especially attractive if you want AWD. Quiet, comfortable, but still some ""feel of the road"" and driving involvement. Probably a good choice coming out of a Mazda.

Sonata: I got to try it on the highway today on the way home from the dealer. On a bombed out stretch of I95 through Philly (they are rebuilding that stretch) it drove very well. nice steering, solid handling, seemed to have good road feel, controlled buy comfy ride. excellent seats. And very quiet (just don't hear traffic noise).

I got the 2.4 model Sonata, and it has plenty of power I think. Certainly on par with your current car. I would have considered a 1.6, but they are not actually out yet. Plus I don't think you can get some of the fancier goodies on it (moonroof, nav). I would expect it to drive similarly. It does have 16"" wheels instead of 17"", so maybe a softer ride?

Overall, I like all your choices. Basically my short list (with the Mazda too) after I decided that the Accord EX just did not quite work for me. With the Camry the outlier (there more for $ reasons).

Sonata won with Legacy probably 2nd and Mazda 3rd. $/feature content really tipped the scales, but it stood out on it's own dynamically. I actually thought the Sonata and Legacy were very similar, the way the interior was laid out, styling and driving dynamics."
m6user,Nov-14,"Thanks for the good info. She's not interested in nav or sunroof. She doesn't even care about heated seats and we live in Chicago area. Guess she just looks at her car as transportation and doesn't want to break the bank for bells and whistles. I like the Legacy on paper as well and our daughter is very satisfied with her 2014 Outback. Would really like to know how quiet the Legacy is at highway speeds with a lot of heavy semi traffic around. I've read that the new Sonata is very, very quiet and that is something she is looking for. I don't know, maybe living with me she needs to meditate or something to get through the day! The Malibu is last on my list as I still don't feel real comfortable with GM. I've owned a lot of GM cars/trucks in the past but they lost favor with me in the mid nineties. I've owned Japanese vehicles for the past 20 years and was pleasantly shocked at how problem free they have been compared to all of my previous U.S. makes."
nyccarguy,Nov-14,"@m6user‌

I'll echo @stickguy's statements about the Passat. A few months back I test drove a 2014 Passat TDI SEL. It was comfortable and extremely smooth. If you are looking for a solid, quiet as a bank vault highway cruiser, I'd put it way up on your short list. Long term VW ownership can be polarizing. Proceed with caution.

We think too much alike stick. You pretty much described my Legacy in a nut shell. Definitely not as quiet (engine noise wise) as the Passat TDI I test drove, the 3.6R Limited might be a smoother operator. I can tell you that I'm really impressed with my Legacy's ride quality. It soaks up road imperfections and nasty pot holes quite nicely. It does transmit a decent amount of road feel too, which I like. I'd recommend it to anybody."
stickguy,Nov-14,"I can vouch that on the highway, in the Sonata you don't hear the cars around you. Even better if you don't need the fancy stuff. A base SE with the options package (convenience? Premium? something like that) which adds a power drivers seat, spare tire and I think BLIS (what I would consider the minimum acceptable configuration) only stickers for something like 23.5K, and is quite well equipped.

Legacy is similar. I would stick with the premium 2.5i level. that gets you a power seat and some other niceties. That is probably going to be in the same 24K range."
m6user,Nov-14,"Tks stickguy. I also have a RDX(2013). How would you compare the quietness of the new Sonata to your RDX?

yeah the Popular Equip Pkg for the Sonata adds:
auto headlights
10 way power driver seat
5"" color touchscreen
Rear camera
Blue Link
Leatherette door panels(???)
Temp Spare

Adds $1200 to base SE price which seems like a decent deal."
stickguy,Nov-14,"Oh, I think the popular package is essential, and yes, a good deal I would get the spare tire anyway, and I hate not having a power drivers seat. and the back up cam is a must IMO. rear visibility is actually better in the Sonata than some other cars now (Fusion being one!) but still nice to have.

I actually think it is quieter than the RDX. The real wildcard of course is tire noise and road surface, so would have to compare back to back on the same road. But I think outside noise is suppressed even better in thy Hyundai."
explorerx4,Nov-14,"My fusion has Upgraded wheel and tire pkg, factory NAV, and moonroof. I don't remember the breakdown, but some of them retained a good percentage of the MSRP, last time I checked.."
m6user,Nov-14,"If you don't want certain bells and whistles in the first place they aren't worth anything even if they do retain some value. We had a sunroof in our past Infiniti and probably opened it 5 or 6 times in 10 years. I have one in my RDX and have maybe opened it twice in two years. Total waste for us but others like so to each their own. Now, NAV I like but the wife doesn't like to fuss with it. She still likes to look at a paper map. Gives her a sense of place I guess."
m6user,Nov-14,"Both Hyundai and GM give military discounts to retired military so that may enter into our decision if she likes two cars the same and we are then just dealing on price. Toyota gives vets/retirees military discount if discharged/retired in the past year. Doesn't apply to me as I retired 5 years ago. Subaru military discount is just for active duty folks which is cool too. Never could figure out though why they would give someone that does two years stateside a nice ""military appreciation"" discount but if you did 33 years and deployed to war zones half a dozen times you're out of luck unless it was all within a year ago???"

I'm always finding new little things. The door lock buttons have little red lights in them, that let you know the doors are locked. When I was washing it the other day, I noticed the turn signals n the side view mirrors flash when the key is in range of the car.

[Deleted User],Nov-14,"I had a Doctors appointment today right across the street from a large area Ford dealer. I was looking for a Fusion SE with the 2.0 turbo. Good luck. They had zero in stock. You had to jump to the Titanium for $35,000 sticker. Frustrated, I was about to leave when I saw the new Mustangs. There was a 2.3 Eco -boost (code for turbo) in this really cool greenish-black color, 5 star rims, gigantic disc brakes, and a sticker of 30,l10 with the ""Track Pack"". So, they only had one on the lot, and two GT's that were in the low 42k, so I struck up a conversation with a guy waiting to test drive it.... we hit is off pretty good, so I squeezed into the back seat and the purchaser, salesperson, and my 6 foot 2 self went on a high speed joy ride on I-95. The back seat is cramped for an adult.... but I have 5 more years until my nest is empty and I have GOT to have one. It was refined, and put out every bit of 310 hp and 300n lb-ft of torque.

In magazine pictures it looks very similar to the outgoing model... but in person it is bad-a**. Also, the ride was fantastic with the new IRS module. Again, Ford is the ONLY domestic brand I would consider."

I loved it. I have always wanted one...now, if they pop the 2.3 in the Fusion AWD....that would be one heck of a 4 door sedan. It will never happen, but one can dream.... If ny of you car guys stopped in at Ford and saw one...I guarantee you will start to drool like a rabid raccoon. I LOVE the style of the Fusion.

It's low and small inside. Drive one and see if you fit."
nyccarguy,Nov-14,"@explorerx4‌

I can also tell you that you should look at either a Legacy or Forester with the 2.5L motor as well. A few people I spoke to about their Imprezas (they own or have driven Crosstreks) is that to call their acceleration sluggish is an understatement. Not to say that an imprezza isn't a fantastic car in the snow.

I spoke to a guy at a gas station in PA that had CT plates also. He traded in his 10 year old X-Terra for the Crosstrek. He can fit pretty much everything in his imprezza that he did in his X-Terra. He had a cargo box on the top. He loves the mileage of the Imprezza (he claimed to get 10 - 14 mpg with the X-Terra), but he said he has to plan his passing maneuvers carefully.

My uncle in CA bought a crosstrek over the summer. He's happy with the car, but told me it is ""dead slow."" He's also coming from a V6 powered 2003 TL.

I drove one on my 1st visit to the Subaru dealer. Around town it was fine. I didn't take it out on the highway though. It was comfortable and beautiful interior materials for the base model.

In the end, I decided on a Legacy with the 2.5 L motor and less options for a similar price. I had the dealer price out an Imprezza Sport Limited and ended up with a Legacy Premium."
explorerx4,Nov-14,"@nyccarguy‌
A Crosstrek is on my list. Don't need a lot of power. It would be a winter driver/grocery getter/spare car with some cargo capacity."
nyccarguy,Nov-14,"So if you would just be using it for local errands, I think you'd be fine with an Imprezza or Crosstrek. You are in a great location to ""shop around"" in Central CT between all the dealers in CT, MA, & even closer to me in NY you should be able to find the right car at the right price."
explorerx4,Nov-14,"@nyccarguy, That's the practical option. I have lots of others in mind."
stickguy,Nov-14,"actually, from what I recall in the reviews, you are better off getting a plain imprezza instead of the crosstrek. Same body basically, but quicker, better handling, and better MPG. And cheaper. just not quite as ""macho"" or ""cool"".

I imagine one of these on a set of winter tires will be just about unstoppable. Unless you are out near Buffalo, where they are getting about 6' of snow (that is feet, not inches) this week.

You could not pay me enough to move back up to the snow belt!"
explorerx4,Nov-14,"@stickguy. Everyone has their own criteria. I want something with some ground clearance. Don't really care about quick or handling. I have other vehicles for that. The only person I know that had an Imprezza, didn't like it. Not sure I would like the Crosstrek, but it's on my list to look at.

My car is kind of low.... but not any lower than an Altima or a Fusion. They had A HUGE METAL PLATE that the parking manager and his cronies pulled out on a hand truck. I backed up... they set up the plate, shored it up with bricks, and I drove out w/o incident. I am going to Kia today for my free oil change (it has been 5,000 miles) , then while they have it on the lift I am taking pictures of ANY component that is damaged, and the parking Valet said his company would pay for it. I snapped picks of the car totally off it's rear wheels and if you pushed on the trunk, the front wheels were off the ground.. Who is the mot***fu**er that designed that deck?

Just to let everyone know where we stand so far and the versions we are interested in they are as follows and all are 2015 I4 automatics.

1. Accord Sport
2. Camry SE
3. Legacy Premium

They are all around $24-25k MSRP. However, from doing a little net research it appears the Camrys are being discounted about $3-$4k, the Honda $2-$3k and the Legacy maybe $2k. So it appears the street price would be around $21-22K on each.

Now it's up to the wife to test drive each and make a decision.

Why the Malibu got struck. Dealer experience sucked, the transmission constantly hunted for the right gear, didn't like the start-stop feature, lots of bells and whistles were only available if you signed up for On-Star subscription which my wife would never go for. Heavy steering had no feel for the road and car was a little floaty as well.

Why the Jetta got struck. I liked it a lot. The 1.8T in that car is plenty quick and the car handles nicely but it was a lttile tighter than desired on the inside. Basically it was the price to get what she wants was a little high and she's hesitant on the reliability front after being spoiled by the Mazda. She plans on keeping the car for probably 6-8 years.

Why the Sonata got struck. The Sonata almost made the list. It was a much better drive than the one I tested several years ago when we bought the Mazda. Interior on the 2015 is very nice and seems to be pretty much on par with Accord. Still a little floaty and the transmission hunted for the right gear sometimes. Dealership just as disorganized it was several years ago. The dealership is nothing against the car but I have to feel at least somewhat confident that they know what they are doing as I always service at the dealership during warranty periods and obviously recalls."
ab348,Nov-14,I'm curious at what bells and whistles on the Malibu require an OnStar subscription. That would give you the OnStar version of navigation but none of the others at that price point would have nav anyway. I'm confused.
explorerx4,Nov-14,"@m6user, The dealer is pretty important, not only the 'deal'."
brian125,Nov-14,"@m6user,

The Accord Sport is going to win this 3 legged race..


Laying odds 3 to 1............................. with legacy being the dark horse............ Any takers.

Shuffling my line up soon and need some cash."
m6user,Nov-14,"@ab348‌
The salesman just kept showing me all this internet, 4G LTE stuff, guide by voice stuff after I kept telling him my wife really cares nothing about ""connectivity"" either through an MP3 player, USB port or through moving internet. Everything seemed to only be available if you have a ""monthly plan"". Not interested.

I forgot. Another thing on the Malibu was the trunk. It was very narrow(narrower than the others) because on one side there was a compartment that appeared to have a battery in it and I don't know what was on the other side but it intruded about the same amount. In affect all the other cars I could have laid my golf clubs and cart lengthwise right across at the front(by rear bumper) of the trunk as that was the widest spot. The Malibu was too narrow to do that."
m6user,Nov-14,"The Accord Sport may win but it is my wife's decision not mine. If it was mine I would probably chose the Legacy. From looking at the brochures she is liking the Camry so far. Go figure. The only reason the Sport version of the Accord was necessary was to get a power seat. She could care less about the extra 4 hp, trunk lip, dual exhaust or leather steering wheel cover. And she would have probably preferred to stay with the 16"" rims on the LX for the little softer ride and cheaper tire replacement."
brian125,Nov-14,"Accord Sport has 189 h/p oppose to Legacy 175, and Camry 178. Definitely not a game changer. All 3 vehicles are within a inch or so in leg, head, and shoulder room.


If what you say is true about looks of Accord, wheel size, dual pipes etc make the best deal out of the 3 choices.

A great deal can be had with either 3 vehicles right before Dec, 31st."
stickguy,Nov-14,"could always go one step further up and get an EX. About $1,200 more than a Sport!

all fine choices you have. Actually, Accord, Camry and Legacy were my other finalists. Probably should have saved $ and gone with the leftover 2014 Camry. Oh well!"
m6user,Nov-14,Basically that $1200 for the EX pays for a sunroof that neither of us would want or ever use. I know there are a couple of other bells and whistles that come on the EX but I think the main cost is the sunroof.
m6user,Nov-14,The Legacy actually feels much stronger off the line than either the Accord or the Camry even though it has a couple less horses. Obviously it's gearing but perception is reality.
explorerx4,Nov-14,"@m6user, Last sedan my wife drove was a V8 SHO. I'd just have your wife buy the cheapest mid size sedan. My guess is Camry LE. That's what she wants."
brian125,Nov-14,"Right now Subaru and Toyota have no cash incentives on your vehicles. Honda has a 500 cash incentive on the 2015 model.

Wait till Dec I'm sure Toyota will have something going on for the Camry."
stickguy,Nov-14,"The sunroof is a good chunk of that (hey, some of us think that is a plus). Also the lanewatch feature.

I know there are a few other extras, but those are the big ones off the top of my head."
m6user,Nov-14,"'That's what she wants.'

And just why would you say that without knowing anything about my wife? She picked the Mazda6 because of the way it handled and still likes it but doesn't like how much road noise makes it's way into the cabin. The newest Camry does drive better than they used to and from what I've read the SE model would handle a little better than the LE I tested the other day. I didn't test the SE the other day because I didn't realize then that certain things that are in the SE package were important to her. So, no, she is not just looking for the cheapest thing out there.

By the way, the Malibu would probably be the cheapest as they seem to be going for $5-$6k off MSRP around Chicago area."
[Deleted User],Nov-14,"I LOVE my car. I just wish the 2.3T from the Mustang was in it, it had rear drive, and..... and still had all the room in the interior. The interior of the 'stang was an ergonomic nightmare. The buttons were all small and seemed to be made for Gollum or a hobbit or something. I am too big for the car, and so are my kids. It is a pipe dream for a selfish juvenile. Seriously, go drive one... just try to adjust the A/C, find the tiny, tiny mirror controls....fr the Tony tiny mirrors. It does have a back up camera... which was awesome. We should have had those 25 years ago.... by law. Anyway, obviously I am not getting a new mustang... but one can dream."
m6user,Nov-14,"Yes, I know that Honda is offering the dealer cash and I also get $500 for military discount. But I'm not letting pure price influence her decision because something that you keep for 6-8 years and spend that much time in shouldn't be decided by a few hundred dollars."
explorerx4,Nov-14,"@m6user, The Camry SE has a stiff suspension. Read the reviews. LE drives ok and doesn't have the rough ride of an SE. That's why I went with LE for her, and it is the cheapest."
stickguy,Nov-14,"I only sat in a 2015 Camry, but did not drive. However the reviews said that all the 15s have improved handling/control/feel."
brian125,Nov-14,"m6user said:

I agree.

With both incentives from Honda you could very well nail a Accord Sport for 1k plus below dealers invoice on a 2015 model. There have been several buyers I know that got to 1k below already on a 2015. Your area with supply and demand will be a factor. With your incentives buying at 1k below gives dealer there 2% holdback and doc fee charge. You get a great price in return.

Just something to consider."
m6user,Nov-14,"@explorerx4‌
She's used to driving the Mazda6 which has a pretty firm suspension. I said she is looking for a quieter ride, not necessarily a ""softer"" ride. She likes to drive fairly hard(evidenced by several speeding tickets). If Mazda would have chosen to put a little more soundproofing into their car versus trying to take every bit of extra weight out.....skyactiv......it would probably be at the top of the list. The Camry SE is only about $900 more and for what you get including the alloys it's not bad. It will be interesting to drive the SE and see how it really compares with the ride of the LE. On a test drive it may be difficult to really feel the difference unless I try to scare the sh** out of the salesperson."
explorerx4,Nov-14,"@m6user, SE looks better to me, but I like a car that's got something extra in how it looks."
m6user,Nov-14,"Yeah, my wife likes the grill and the alloys.  I like the SE grill better as well but neither of them are really great to my eye."
stickguy,Nov-14,"when I was looking at the Camry, I liked the proportions and wheels on the XLE better. The 18"" wheels on the SE, and some of the side extensions, just did not look right to me. I was mostly interested in the SE for the purported sharper handling, though on my test drives, the XLE drove just fine.

If you are looking at 2015s (likely at this point), road tests indicate that all models have a bit sharper handling, and better body/suspension control (grounded to the ground better?)"
[Deleted User],Nov-14,"The sharpest looking 4 door sedan now is the Mazda 6 GT hands down...but why would I trade my car for one that looks almost exactly the same AND with less power and torque and $5000 more for comparable features so lets just say the Touring model. However, I really would advise you guys to drive a new 'stang and THEN find the closest handling mid-size that emulates it's stance and feel....even the shifter. I would buy a stick Mustang in a heartbeat..but alas; I have veto's from family and common sense took over from there"
[Deleted User],Nov-14,"stickguy said:


Well, then on the Accord EX vs the Sport you lose one exhaust pipe, 1"" smaller and 3/4 inch thinner rims and tires, and about 3 horsepower. However...you gain Pandora, Sat radio, GPS, etc etc. Just to make a point though...I never use Pandora, I let my Sirius become less so, and my Garmin from 2008 works fine. Gosh what a hard decision. I wonder if the dealer would pop in the Infotainment system from abd Accord EX with Sirius and all that...just to make the seal happen. Go in Friday the 28 or Saturday the 29th of December. Wearing a Santa hat will disarm them....and distract them.I wrote my own deal.....like I filled out the buyers order and gave it to the sales manager. He added $100 to my $195 processing fee and said OK.... IF I bought the 10/100 B2B FOR $900. Deal! So $900 plus $300 = $1200 plus 21,000 plus and tags. It came out to $24,000. Total amount financed at 3.9% and $450 a month. I put NOTHING down.

The rear of the Camry now looks just like the Sonata, like they rolled one into the body shop and said ""make it look like this...but not enough to get sued!""

Legacy and Sonata are a tie in my mind, but my mind was one of the one that was a terrible thing to waste. Actually the ad was about me and my friend who listened to NWA, Slayer, Pantera, Motorhead, and anything else hard core; all at a level of volume that would have killed most rodents."
nyccarguy,Nov-14,"A few minor points. This morning, I helped the guy in the garage park a current body style Accord. Definitely a different car from my Legacy.

The Accord's 4 cyl motor idles smooth and super quiet. If you didn't know better, you'd think there was a V6 under the hood. Stark contrast to my Legacy's Flat 4 which sounds thrashy when I 1st fire it up and eventually calms down.

The Accord's Backup Camera Lines move with the steering wheel. My Legacy's lines stay straight. My Legacy has a much better resolution backup camera.

The Accord's steering seemed to have a better slow speed feel than my Legacy."
m6user,Nov-14,"According to the salesman the Accord back up camera can be user selected to either straight lines or moving with the steering wheel.

I noticed those same exact things during my test drives. In fact, the Accord was the quietest both at idle and on heavy acceleration of all the vehicles I test drove last week. The Legacy also was very abrupt at take off which one can get used to but was a bit of a start at the time. How's your Legacy on the expressway regarding road noise and noise from surrounding traffic?"
m6user,Nov-14,"@cski‌
Re: the Accord Sport vs. Legacy. You mentioned you lose one tailpipe and 3/4"" of tire tread on the Legacy. That's true. But it's only missed if one cares about it in the first place. Here are some things the Legacy Premium(which is cheaper MSRP) has that the Accord Sport doesn't have.

1. Better MPG
2. More interior room
3. AWD
4. Heated Seats
5. Push button start
6. 6 speaker vs. 4 for Accord
7. Sliding center armrest
8. LED brake lights
9. Heated side mirrors
10. Lighted glove box
11. Leather gearshift knob
12. Voice recognition
13. Larger gas tank (more range is always nice to have)
14. Cargo tie downs
15. HD Radio
16. Driver and passenger auto up/down vs. just the driver's in the Accord
17. Aluminum spare vs. steel

Granted, some of these items are of negligible importance and to be fair the Accord also has a few(very few and minor) things that the Legacy doesn't have. But taken in totality the Subaru is quite the value. It's not quite as refined as the Accord IMO but all those pluses are hard to ignore especially for a lower MSRP. I have a feeling between dealer cash, military rebate and dealer concessions the Accord would most likely have a lower street price. I'm the pros and cons person and she is ""oh I like the color and how it drives, I like this one"" type. We both know it so that is why she has me do the recon and she does the sniping when it comes to something she will drive 98% of the time."
nyccarguy,Nov-14,"@m6user‌

I think @cski was comparing the Accord Sport to the Accord EX.

I can certainly give it a shot to answer your questions objectively:

I don't think the Legacy takes off abruptly at all. Part of that has to do with the AWD system transferring power to the rear wheels during ""take off."" I don't feel that ""lurch"" that I normally do with traditional FWD cars. I think the other part has to to with the H4 engine sitting lower than a tradition I4. More weight lower over the front wheels. I'm not sure about the other cars in the segment, but the Legacy also has liquid filled motor mounts.

My Legacy drives great on the highway. Very smooth and compliant. They use double wishbones up front (like my Prelude) and a multi-link rear set up that most everyone else uses. It soaks up road imperfections nicely.

Mid range passing power is average. It is far from sluggish, but isn't a road rocket by any means. You definitely hear the motor working when you stab the gas pedal. It sounds very mechanical, not unrefined though. I like engine noise though.

There is a hint of wind noise. Road noise is minimal. The tires are quiet. The only other vehicles you hear are tractor trailers and lifted Wranglers with 31"" Mud Tires.

Just looking at a few things on your list, I can tell you that the Legacy Premium DOES NOT have push button start. I can also comment on a few of the others:

3. AWD - This was the MAJOR selling point for me living in New England. I work for a family business and absolutely MUST open up at 7:30 AM, 6 days per week, especially in the cold weather. While I haven't gotten a chance to test out how well it drives in the snow yet, I can tell you the AWD gives the Legacy a much more neutral feel than a traditional front driver. I noticed on the test drive I was going a bit faster than I realized on a ""clover leaf"" exit ramp. The car didn't ""push."" The chassis stayed composed and neutral. I just kept on the gas pedal instead of braking late like I would in a front driver.

4. Heated Seats - They are fantastic.

12. Voice Recognition - It works really well. Light years ahead of my wife's 2011 Pilot (which in its defense is probably 2009 ish technology).

I can't say that my Legacy will get THAT much better or worse gas mileage than an Accord. Nor can I say with absolute certainty that my car has a tremendous range advantage over an Accord.

Obviously price is a factor, but when you plan on keeping a car long term you should get what you (or in this case, your wife) like. Even if it costs a little bit more up front."
m6user,Nov-14,"Thanks for the info, Yeah, I looked back at my list and I think it was a different car that I tested that had the push button start. And I looked back at cski's post and you're right...he was comparing to the EX. Sorry, cski! But my comment about not missing the extra tailpipe and 3/4"" tread still holds.

I definitely felt a lurch. I had to be very careful parking it as just a touch and it wanted to take off. I was watching a video review on youtube yesterday and the reviewer mentioned it as well and I said to myself I know exactly what he is talking about. Maybe your last car had a touchy gas pedal as well so it's not noticeable or maybe the tester I drove had a little ""programming"" fault. But it was there for me. I'll try and get a different car when my wife test drives one and see if it's the same. I had an Infiniti that had a touchy pedal and I got used to it pretty quickly and actually liked it after time.

I noticed also what you said about the heated seats. The three levels were nice......only have two levels on my Acura.

My comments about MPG and range were just that. According to EPA the Legacy gets better MPG and it does have a larger gas tank so range should be better. YMMV of course. I didn't say a lot or ""tremendous"" better.....just better.

Thanks again."

All 3 vehicles are good choices. The Accord will hold the best resale value out of the lot..
The Altima has a slight edge over Accords 27/36 mpg. with a ................... 27/38 mpg rating.

The Camry has a softer ride than a Accord. The Altima has the most legroom at....... 45'

Both Altima and Accord have a Continuously variable-speed automatic ( CVT transmissions). The Camry has 6-speed shiftable automatic.


If you click on the Car Research tab on the top page here - go to compare cars. you could see all 3 vehicles side by side. This will give you a clear picture of all 3 vehicles and help you make a well educated decision after you test drive all three."

sunnx said:"
akirby,Nov-14,"All this objective data comparison is nice but in the end it really comes down to price, styling and personal preferences."
m6user,Nov-14,"Yes, that's what this is about.....personal preferences. There are always compromises and that's why it's good to do data comparisons so one can see if one car has this and that other car has that. It helps to determine what is more important. For example, I really appreciate auto climate control and if I had to choose between a power seat and auto climate control the a.c.c. would win. I rationalize that I drive my Acura 99% of the time and very very rarely adjust the seat. However, I'm constantly fiddling with the climate control when I drive my truck which doesn't have a.c.c. In looking for a new car for my wife I assumed she drives her car all the time so she would feel the same way. Wrong! She would rather have power seat. So data comparisons do come in handy and actually kind of fun if you have the time.

I agree that in the final analysis styling and how if ""feels"" is important. Price really depends on your personal situation. My wife could easily buy a $40k or more car but just wants fairly basic transportation with some style and a few bells and whistles. She just thinks anything more than about $25k is more than wants to spend. She would rather spend on travel. I traveled extensively in both my corporate and military careers and have no desire for that. So I buy the $40k car and play golf......she can travel the world."

They praised the 200 and Sonata as being big improvements over their prior iterations, but not enough to be a Finalist. They liked the Legacy but said it wasn't ""innovative"" enough. Not sure what kind of innovation they're looking for in a mid-sized sedan. They've pretty much been perfected, IMO. Even the 200 seems like a very nice car.

But then, the TLX didn't make Finalist either, and I wouldn't mind having one of those in my garage.

But for those shopping for minivans... the new Sedona was a Finalist."

Hi. It's my very first post here I have a very good offer for a Sonata lease but I would like to know the real mpg I would get. Obviously it depends on many facts but any information you have is valuable. I will be driving about 40 miles, four days a week. It's gonna be mainly on highway of course.
Number two on my list is the Mazda 3 which has more mpg but I didnt get a good offer yet. Thanks"
stickguy,Nov-14,"Not sure where this is or how to reply to it. But I haven't put on enough miles to really know. But, I have had a few legs (per the TC) local mixed driving where I got about 30. Pretty good for a car that size."
brian125,Nov-14,@saamlee92 maybe this will work
backy,Nov-14,"Speaking of good Sonata leases, I saw an ad in my local paper today for $189/month, $0 up front, 36 months/36k miles for a 2015 Sonata (didn't give the trim but I expect base trim). That's the lowest sign-and-drive lease I've seen on a Sonata or comparable car in a long time. The small print was, this included a $1000 holiday bonus for Hyundai owners. I also saw good deals in the same paper on Fusions, Altimas, and Camrys. End of year is a good time to buy a new car!"

explorerx4,Dec-14,Ford Escape is a great little CUV. Get the 2.0 and it will never feel underpowered. My wife has had 3 of them and we have passed the first 2 on to our kids. Now she wants an MKC. I don't think she will go back to a mid size sedan. Last one she had was a 96 SHO.
backy,Dec-14,"Since this is now the Small SUV discussion I'll chime in that I think the new HR-V will be a huge hit. Maybe the new CX-3 also, but I expect the HR-V will win the capacity/flexibility battle, while the CX-3 will be the better handling vehicle. Not that my wife will care about that!"
m6user,Dec-14,From what I've read the CX-3 will have more HP than the HR-V but be just a tad smaller capacity. The CX-3 is supposed to get the base 155 HP 2.0L from the Mazda3 and the HR-V is getting something like 118 hp or something like that. Quite a difference.
backy,Dec-14,"138 hp on the HR-V. If I weren't going to be getting the small SUV for my wife, it might matter. I know the Magic Seats will matter! I'll check out both of them, though. We won't be getting the SUV for nearly a year. Plenty of time for test drives! A gently used CR-V or Forester is another option--would probably cost the same or less than a new HR-V or CX-3."

ahightower,Dec-14,"backy said:

Agreed. The HRV is basically the size of the original CRV. That remains a very popular used car, I still see them everywhere around here. HRV is going to be a hit. People love the current small CUVs - CRV, RAV4, etc. - but they have gotten pricy. I wouldn't say the CRV is ""too big"" by any stretch, but the upcoming micro-SUVs will be plenty big enough for anyone under 6' tall and without children in the house. Of course the Honda Element was meant to fill that niche and it never quite took off, perhaps a little too funky, but times have changed a bit."
ahightower,Dec-14,"robr2 said:show previous quotesFrom the asking prices I've seen, used CR-V's are like used Accords and Civics - they get stupid money.Also true. This is why I bought my Accord new. Why buy a lightly used Honda when cheap financing nearly offsets the low depreciation, and you get to be the one putting those first 40-50K on it? And my Mazda3 new, back in '07, for 15% less than the comparable new Civic, or very little more than a three-year-old used one."
robr2,Dec-14,"backy said:

Around here only 2-3 year old LX (2012) models can be had under $20. The EX's are typically $22K and above.

A dealer is asking almost $24K for a 2012 EX-L with 35K miles. A 2015 is $29K and one could easily get that to $27-27.5. IMHO, buying it used, makes no sense."

I think the Chrysler 200 is pretty and all...but look at their track record.The mid-90's ""cab forward"" cars...the Intrepid and the first gen (well, resurrected new gen 300's, etc) all of them are in junk yards,.Very few still on the road. Most in junk yards,.Having Fiat platforms under a lot of these
Chriat's spurs zero confidence in me, I will never buy one...I don't even have any desire to go look at their offerings. You either get a ghetto 300, a euro-ghetto 200, and then they do a full flip and offer the same 300 platform as an all American muscle car Chargers, Challengers, etc. I just don't trust them. Unless you buy a macked out Challenger 392 or Charger special model X, drive it for 10,000 miles, then dump some sta-bil in the tank and leave it for 40 years under a tarp, your wasting your money. Oh, You have to take the rims off too and stack them sideways and leave the car on jack stands. Who in their right mind is gonna do that? No one.

BTW. Does ANYONE remember the first gen Chrysler 300 from the 50's and 60's? I don't either."
m6user,Dec-14,"Re midsize sedans.....just read an article about how Mazda is still trying to get it's diesel right to bring it to the U.S. in the Mazda6. Seems they aren't satisfied with the power it's putting out after meeting the standards here. At least that's what they say is the problem. Anyway, saw on the news where the lowest gas price in the country is in OK City and is $1.99 for RUG. On the same sign I noticed that diesel was $3.39. I know it's somewhat of an extreme occurrence but it would make me think twice ab out getting a diesel."

I'm 57 and I do remember them. They were the first hemi engines used by Chrysler and the cars were tanks. IIRC, they used the 392 hemi engine in the 50s and 60s."
brian125,Dec-14,1955 was the 1st year for the 300. They took the front of a Imperial and combined it with another car don't remember. Chrysler's hemi engine came out around 1951 maybe 52. I'm sure you could find pic's online of this vehicle.

Was kind of disappointed until I looked at last year's numbers, about 2 mpg less last year. Premium is 48 cents more a gallon. Although the car runs a little smoother, I'm driving faster, so I'll go back to RUG after the 3rd tank. When the weather warms up, maybe I'll try the same thing again.

I am probably going to teach my daughter to drive on it (or maybe I should use my moms 2010 Forte' lol). It has so many dings and dents that she probably wouldn't notice a few more.

My oldest will be 15 in October, but I find that the older I get, the faster time goes. I have a feeling the Optima will be THE family car until it no longer makes monetary sense to maintain it. I bet I will still get $5,000 for it in 5 years.,

backy,Dec-14,"You'll get a lot more than $5k for your Optima after 5 years, if you keep it maintained and in good condition.

That car listed for $17.4k in 2004 and I bought it for $13.2k. Cars keep increasing in price, plus Kia's reputation is on the upswing."
[Deleted User],Dec-14,"Yes, But the market here is saturated. There are so many cars available that is really a buyers market. WHat I am counting on is the beauty of the car.

Example. 1997 Acura Integra GS-R. I would buy one with the 5-speed and the wing right now for $6000 in excellent condition with less than 100k. It's a beautiful, killer handling, with a super-engineered, sweet sounding when revved V-Tech engine.

Next example: 3rd Generation Toyota Celica (81-85). This car weighed very little, had great quality, and had the biggest 4 cyl ever offered in a celica, a 2.4 liter in the GTS model. Made that period Mustangs quiver in their shocks. In immaculate condition $5000

So, really depends on the car of course. I think the style of my car along with the quality interior and the good power in the base engine will make this car a classic in 10 years"

Ahhhh practicality. Everybody's worst enemy. I'm sure it would be a tight squeeze (depending on how big your kids are and how often you have all 3 of them in the car with you), but not as tight as the Mustang. I know you are looking for a little more zip. Would you consider a WRX?"

It's all relative. In terms of storage capacity/flexibility, sure. But if you want a sporty, good-handling hatch that's also fuel-efficient, a better choice IMO would be the Mazda3 or Golf TDI. The Impreza, Forte5 (200 hp turbo available!), and Elantra GT are very nice hatches also, albeit not with ""Magic Seats"" like the Fit. And the Focus SE is a great value in a nice-handling and fuel-efficient hatch. Then there's the Fiesta ST, for a lot of fun-per-dollar. Different strokes (and hatches) for different folks."
[Deleted User],Dec-14,"My brother in law is the only person I know that drives faster than me. We have both had hospital -level wrecks, and I am proud of none of it...just background for the story.

He bought a WRX about 10 years ago and pushed it hard (he had the wagon version...I thought it was super-ugly). Until I drove it. Wow! It sticks to the road like glue. Anyway, he never wrecked it, had two kids, and bought (was forced to buy by his other half) a Grand Cherokee V8 (04).

I had a 99 Grand Cherokee V8 by sheer coincidence. Never wrecked it.

So my dear mid size friends, the Grand Cherokee was a nice driving, powerful, safe family truckster. .

So why am I talking about SUV's? Well, I am really talking about AWD/4x4 and how much safer I felt with it. I believe it made a difference in having or not having an accident it seems. So, I would really like AWD on my next car, but I have grown up a bit in 10 years.

So, If I was to buy a AWD mid size it would have to be the Legacy AWD, the Fusion 2.0T AWD, and thats about it.

akirby,Dec-14,"Maybe this report is right and CR has no credibility.

Honestly - there is no objective way to measure this stuff that's realistic and accurate. So much of a car experience is subjective and subject to individual preferences that any kind of ranking based on such things is pretty worthless.

But we've been very happy with it, it's exceeded expectations, and I got a great deal on the lease (and got rid of a beat-up 2007 Sonata painlessly). I wouldn't hesitate to get a new Sonata next year (assuming a good deal) if that's the kind of vehicle we wanted after the lease is up--but we're going for a small SUV next time. But if looking for a new mid-sizer, I'd also look closely at the Accord, Mazda6, Optima, Legacy, and Fusion."
carandetc,Dec-14,"Would a corolla be considered a mid size sedan?
I just rented one and the rental company labeled it as mid size.

I feel it could be considered sporty but ""under radar"". Remember those first Audi Wagons V8? or the first WRX? Nobody suspected what is under their hood.

Anyways, Corolla has no power of V8 or the handling of WRX
but when I hit the red line 6500, I actually forgot what car I am driving.

Who would suspect this car can zoom by a V6?
My car had a 4 speed Auto so just down shift to 2 or L, and rev it up, not sure if you can do that with a CVT.

I was also surprised how it keeps the line, never had the feeling it will flip over.
the steering is kind of sporty stiff almost thought it doesn't have power.
The suspension could use some stiffer springs but I think there is a model S with sports suspension.

So overall your wife and kids would enjoy the comfortable and spacious ride,
once you drop them off and hit 5-6000 rpm, I could feel like in a sporty but affordable sedan."
stickguy,Dec-14,"must have been the prior generation. The current model does have a CVT.

Rental car companies have their own ""unique"" definition of size. Surprised they didn't consider it a full size!

explorerx4,Dec-14,"I know the current Corolla has lots of interior room, but the drivetrain is still 20 years old."
backy,Dec-14,"Yep, rental companies are one size up on cars. So cars like the Fiesta are compacts, cars like the Cruze, Focus, and Corolla are mid-sized, and cars like the Camry and Sonata are full-sized. Not sure what they consider a real full-sized car like the Avalon to be!

There is a 4-speed automatic variant of the current Corolla that is most likely aimed at fleet use."
zandor60657,Dec-14,"backy said:

Newer is better, right? Except for the VW Passat and Chrysler 200 they ranked the designs in order of age. Here are the cars in the order they ranked them with the year of their last full redesign:

Even though you weren't responding to me, yes. Price, AWD, & Reliability were very important factors (probably the 3 most) in my decision. I had a budget of less than $27K. I ended up buying my Legacy for $23,800 plus tax. I'm happy with the car and what I got for the price I paid. I do wish for some more power though;)"
m6user,Dec-14,"My wife finally had time to drive the Accord, Camry and Legacy yesterday. The Legacy is in very short supply right now. The dealer we went to only had two and they were both demos. He just delivered one to a guy that ordered it in October.

Anyway, she wants to drive them all one more time before she makes a decision but she ranked them so far Camry SE, Legacy Premium, Accord LX. We drove both the Accord Sport and the LX and we both(I sat in back) found the LX to be much quieter and I assume the main culprit is probably the 18"" tires vs. the 16"" on the LX. Also it's possible the dual exhaust adds a little more engine growl but it was definitely lounder. She also didn't think the radio sounded as good in the Accord vs. Camry and also didn't ride as smooth. She wants a smooth, quiet ride and ease of use. She found the controls on the Camry to be a little more intuative FOR HER and she actually really liked the way it looked. The Legacy radio system confused her quite a bit although she liked the sound. She doesn't care about the AWD at all. She's been driving in Chicago for 40 years with either RWD or FWD and doesn't have a problem as long as her tires have good tread.

I know the Camry is hated in here and sometimes I think it gets to the extreme and a little childish actually. It's called piling on in football,. It really isn't a bad car at all. I personally would chose the Accord for a number of reasons one of which is that is somewhat familiar as I currently drive an Acura. These cars are all appliances and I don't mean that derogatorily and it's possible the Camry is a little more ""appliance"" than the others. But, it seems to have a lot of the things that people that just want a quiet, dependable commute to work want. That's pretty much what my wife wants. She doesn't really like to drive all that much.

Funny thing happened when we drove the Legacy. We took it out by ourselves and I asked her why she had the driver's seat so low as it looked like she was sitting in a hole. She said it was alright. After a couple of miles I again said she should adjust her seat. She admitted she didn't know how and I told her to just pull up on the knob that also adjusts for forward and rear travel(power seat). She was shocked when it rose up, up, up. She then asked me if the Mazda6 which she has driven for the past 6 years could do that and I said yes it can! She also didn't realize that the steering wheel on the Mazda could be moved both up/down and telescopically. Like I said, she likes the simple, ease of use she apparently found in the Camry. And no she's not a dummy, she makes 6 figures but just gets in the car and drives and doesn't mess around with it much. You should have seen her face when the salesman tried to explain the CVT to her. Classic!

It just goes to show you that some people just don't care a whole lot about the bells and whistles and latest stuff but just want to get from point A to point B safely, cheaply and dependably."
stickguy,Dec-14,"from what you listed as her criteria, sounds like the perfect Camry buyer. But why the SE? lower profile tires and some odd plastic attachments don't seem like things that would matter to her.]

but dang, not knowing the seat could be raised? talk about car Luddite! You should have done a better job showing her around how the thing works.

I did like the Camry XLE though. The last time I stopped, if I had actually taken the time to get an updated price, I may have brought that home instead. As long as you don't expect anything exciting, good to go."
m6user,Dec-14,"She hasn't completely decided yet and that's why she wants to drive them all again. Believe it or not she actually likes the grill on the Camry SE a lot better than the grill on the LE as they are completely different. She also wants alloy wheels which come on the SE but the LE has wheel covers. I think there is a couple other little differences too and the price difference is only about $900.

Yeah, as far as the seat goes, she knew it had a power seat and I assumed (like pretty much anybody would) that it would be obvious. There is no obvious when it comes to some women and mechanical items. When I went to the Gulf War on short notice I quickly showed her exactly how to start the snowblower and use it. Very simple, right? Well, when I got back 5 months later it had never been started and she had shoveled when necessary. Luckily, it was a light winter in Chicago that year!

I guess that's the problem with a lot of us that visit and post on these forums. We know quite a bit about all the vehicles and what they offer and take it for granted that the most simple things are understood by everybody. Well, they aren't sometimes. I just read an article of an elderly couple in New Zealand that locked themselves in their new Mazda3 for 13 hours and almost died. Getting out was simple but they couldn't figure it out in their panic. Always train to the lowest common denominator."
nyccarguy,Dec-14,"@m6user‌

Funny you should mention the Legacy being in short supply. When I went back to the dealer about a month after I bought the car to pick up my plates (I live in CT & bought the car in NY), I was talking to my sales guy. He told me they are having trouble getting their hands on 2015 Legacys. He even joked with me that if I wanted to he would have his GM pay me to use my car to send out in test drives on a Saturday;)

Thanks for the update on your wife's car shopping."

My wife finally had time to drive the Accord, Camry and Legacy yesterday. The Legacy is in very short supply right now. The dealer we went to only had two and they were both demos. He just delivered one to a guy that ordered it in October. Anyway, she wants to drive them all one more time before she makes a decision but she ranked them so far Camry SE, Legacy Premium, Accord LX. We drove both the Accord Sport and the LX and we both(I sat in back) found the LX to be much quieter and I assume the main culprit is probably the 18"" tires vs. the 16"" on the LX. Also it's possible the dual exhaust adds a little more engine growl but it was definitely lounder. She also didn't think the radio sounded as good in the Accord vs. Camry and also didn't ride as smooth. She wants a smooth, quiet ride and ease of use. She found the controls on the Camry to be a little more intuative FOR HER and she actually really liked the way it looked. The Legacy radio system confused her quite a bit although she liked the sound. She doesn't care about the AWD at all. She's been driving in Chicago for 40 years with either RWD or FWD and doesn't have a problem as long as her tires have good tread. I know the Camry is hated in here and sometimes I think it gets to the extreme and a little childish actually. It's called piling on in football,. It really isn't a bad car at all. I personally would chose the Accord for a number of reasons one of which is that is somewhat familiar as I currently drive an Acura. These cars are all appliances and I don't mean that derogatorily and it's possible the Camry is a little more ""appliance"" than the others. But, it seems to have a lot of the things that people that just want a quiet, dependable commute to work want. That's pretty much what my wife wants. She doesn't really like to drive all that much. Funny thing happened when we drove the Legacy. We took it out by ourselves and I asked her why she had the driver's seat so low as it looked like she was sitting in a hole. She said it was alright. After a couple of miles I again said she should adjust her seat. She admitted she didn't know how and I told her to just pull up on the knob that also adjusts for forward and rear travel(power seat). She was shocked when it rose up, up, up. She then asked me if the Mazda6 which she has driven for the past 6 years could do that and I said yes it can! She also didn't realize that the steering wheel on the Mazda could be moved both up/down and telescopically. Like I said, she likes the simple, ease of use she apparently found in the Camry. And no she's not a dummy, she makes 6 figures but just gets in the car and drives and doesn't mess around with it much. You should have seen her face when the salesman tried to explain the CVT to her. Classic! It just goes to show you that some people just don't care a whole lot about the bells and whistles and latest stuff but just want to get from point A to point B safely, cheaply and dependably.
Have her drive the Accord EX.  IMHO there is a significant difference in the ride vs the LX.  I didn't want a sunroof, but after driving the LX & EX, the EX was so much better, the sunroof became a non-issue.  I also drove the Camry LE and for me the Accord EX was the choice.  The 17"" wheels on the EX made a pretty big difference in the ride.  The upholstery in the LX looked cheap to me - the EX was nicer by far.  Plus, the blind spot monitor in the EX is great.  

I I know I sound like a Honda fanboy, and I apologize for that, but the EX is really very nice and I'm in love with mine (only had it a week but I think I will remain in love).  I'm tall, but the I have plenty of headroom even with the sunroof. 

As always, your mileage may vary.

suydam,Dec-14,"I've had my EX-L a year and a half and I still love it. Hondas are for those who like a slightly firmer ride, although maybe not as much as the Mazda. I feel more confident in its handling that way. It is extremely comfortable on long drives. If you like a cushy ride the Camry or Nissan Altima is probably the way to go. I haven't driven a Sonata so can't speak to that car."
m6user,Dec-14,"My wife has driven a Mazda6 for 6.5 years so I think she knows how a little sharper handling feels. She does like it very much but as we all know in here, the Mazda6 and the Accord are not the quietest cars for road noise even though they have both improved in that area. Others have improved as well so it's all relative it seems. And I just got through test driving both and they are better but not as quiet as some of the others.

And, after driving the Mazda6 which has been trouble free for all those years, she wants something softer riding and quieter. I tested the Altima but the interior seemed really old and in need of a revision and the CVT, even though having been used by Nissan so many years, still seemed more ""whiny"" than either the Accord or the Legacy tranny. Like I said what I might like as more of an auto nut is different from what she wants and this will be her car.

Originally the Mazda6 was bought as a second car for me but shortly after purchase she took it over because because gas was hitting $4.00 a gallon and she had a long commute. So she passed off her Infiniti QX4 to me as I didn't have to commute much. I ended up enjoying the QX4 very much which is probably why I bought the Acura RDX I'm driving. The golf clubs/cart fit perfectly in the rear and I'm always ready if the weather permits!"
suydam,Dec-14,We definitely found the Altima CVT to be whiny. Accord is very quiet. It drives like any other auto trans. I will say the Camry controls were quite simple and intuitive. It does feel like a larger car compared to Honda or Mazda. It's all a matter or priorities. Any of them should be quite reliable.
brian125,Dec-14,"The Accord is a lot quieter than previous years and such a leap forward in every aspect. I found my 2013 V-6 Accord the best choice out of the lot. The V-6 Altima was my runner up to the Accord in 2013.
The new Camry and Malibu have the best road noise isolation out of the group mentioned. But both fell short in my eyes.

It actually seem to me the Malibu rode almost as good as the Accord if not better. Legroom was bad in the Malibu. What knocks Malibu out of the box is... its a GM product with terrible resale. Good car to lease not own"
suydam,Dec-14,"Legroom is surprisingly poor in the Malibu. I took my 6'4"" son car shopping and he barely fit in the Malibu. I think he will be getting an Impala. All the midsizers are kinda tight for him."
brian125,Dec-14,The new Impala scares me. Side and rear visibility is awful. I drove one 6 months ago.
suydam,Dec-14,"He's looking at the older one, maybe 2 or 3 years old. Visibility seemed pretty good in those. He is not a car person. His current ride is a '98 LeSabre with bench front seats. He likes cars very plain with little technology. So a 2012 or so Impala would do quite well. And they are cheap!"
brian125,Dec-14,"A..... 2/3 year old Impala has much better visibility. You will get a good deal on one.

I'm almost 6'2 leg and hip room are very important to me also. There are not many cars today with bench seating in the front."
ryster,Dec-14,"Legacy availability must vary by region. Here in Southeastern PA dealers have plenty. There are 3 Subaru dealers in my local vicinity, and between the three of them they have a total of 33 Legacys in inventory."
suydam,Dec-14,"""A..... 2/3 year old Impala has much better visibility. You will get a good deal on one.""

Did he ever. He just bought a 2013 Impala LT for under $14k with 2 years left on warranty. If you are into basic transportation that's hard to beat."

There is no Subaru Legacy supply problems here. There are about 15 of them on our local dealers lot. However, we are not in the snow belt, so AWD is not a big concern here. If we get 20"" of snow, everything closes. Enjoy the shoveling and hot cocoa Cuz you are not going anywhere until day 2."

Check out the 2013/ 2014.................... R-Spec Genesis Sedan 5.0

The body style is not as sloped as you may like . Its bigger than a midsize car, real sharp looking inside and out. Has 429 H/P. If you put the wing package on the hood ,truck and wheels makes this vehicle look even sharper. I get more complements with this car than any other car I had.

There are published track time reports 0-60 in 4.9 / 5.0 /5.1/ 5.2 / depending on year and reporting mag.

benjaminh,Jan-15,"Nissan Altima vs. Honda Accord

Over the holidays I had a two-day c. 200 mile rental experience with a 2014 Nissan Altima. As some of you know, I am a long-time Honda Accord fan, and so feel free to take what I say with a grain of salt. But anyway, although I liked the Altima overall, like some professional reviewers I thought that the Accord was superior in most areas. Here are my thoughts.

Styling: I liked the exterior looks of the Altima up-close and in person better than I thought I would. Seemed sculptural and solid, and I liked the looks of the standard dual exhaust (compared to the single exhaust for the 4-cylinder Accord). Inside the Accord seemed nicer to me compared to the rather grim black on black on black interior color of the Altima. I think the Accord has an edge overall when it comes to styling, but they are both good-looking cars, and obviously this is a matter of opinion and personal preference.

Features: Here's where the Accord shines. And this is not a matter of opinion but a clear distinction in terms of the Accord offering more and better standard features for the money. I own a 2013 Accord EXL Navi, but my mother owns a base 2013 Accord LX, which I've driven extensively. And so this is comparing the standard Accord with the standard Altima. First, the LX Accord has very nice looking alloy wheels as standard, while the Altima has comparatively cheap-looking plastic ""wheel covers."" Inside, there are more standard features the Accord has that the Altima lacks, such as: the Accord has a standard rear-view back up camera, standard dual zone climate control, more rear headroom, two lights on each ""vanity"" mirror rather than one, a standard adjustable steering wheel, etc.

These are things that I really missed. I mean, at this point I count on a new car having a rear back up camera. And during our long drive I kept turning down the heat slightly, while my wife kept turning it up. Almost everything seemed a not quite as nice in the Altima compared to the Accord. In the Accord, for instance, the sun shades have a more expensive feeling and sounding movement, plus lights on each side of the vanity mirrors, as mentioned. The Altima's sunshades go into the ceiling with a cheap and rather loud thump, and they have just one light for the vanity mirrors that seems much less effective--esp. if you were a woman trying to fix her makeup.

Engine, transmission, and handling: Again, I think the Accord seemed superior, although perhaps this is more a matter of opinion. The sound of the Accord's engine seemed more refined to me than the rather harsh and crude growl of the Altima engine during hard acceleration. Both of these cars have CVT transmissions, but the Altima's CVT lugged, whined, and in general was less pleasant than the Accord's. The steering feel, admittedly not great for either car, seems more natural and less twitchy on the Accord than the Altima. In terms of handling, I think the Accord seems more stable and even sporty, and has less wallow around sharp corners. And my wife commented that the Accord is significantly quieter at highway speeds than the Altima.

Seat comfort: At first the Altima seemed as good as the Accord, but over a c. 4 hour drive the rather squishy seats of the Altima seemed to give me a leg cramp. Perhaps this is a matter of opinion, but I think the Accord's firmer seats are are better and more comfortable, esp. for longer drives.

In terms of rear visibility, I think we can objectively say that the Accord is the best of any midsize car, while the Altima, because of its rear window design and lack of a Hofmeister kink is mediocre.

Nissan, I read somewhere, had grand visions a couple of years ago that the new Altima might become the best selling midsize car in America. But honestly to me, as you can tell, it didn't seem up to the Accord in several areas. Although the Camry and most other midsize cars sell huge numbers to rental fleets, the Accord is the #1 midsize car for retail customers. I think Honda won this fair and square by designing and building a better midsize car.

Oh, but here's one last thing where the Altima seemed better: the standard steering wheel has a better feel than the one on the LX Accord. But the fact that it's not adjustable on the Altima seemed a major drawback. As someone 5' 10"" I was too tall to see about 1/3 of the speedometer. In other words, I could only see up to 60 mph without bending down while driving. Since we were on an Interstate with a 70 mph speed limit, I had to bend down several times to accurately set the cruise control on the Altima. This is just one of many areas where I felt that the Altima hadn't been fully thought out compared to the Accord."
brian125,Jan-15,"benjaminh

Nice review.

I'm going to add to your review.

I test drove both Altima's CVT and the v-6 models. The V-6 would be the model to buy. Altima's CVT is loud , noisy, and annoying. The Accord is a better buy.

Altima had better legroom and I thought the seats were comfortable. I found the seats in my Accord ( Now my daughters Accord ) on long trips to be bothersome especially around the hip area by the console. Altima radio was better, gas mileage about the same, Ride on the Accord firmer. I liked the way the Altima interior lights and dash lit up at night. Accord looks much nicer"
suydam,Jan-15,"We looked extensively at both Accord and Altima before finally choosing the Accord in 2013. It was a hard call. I think it comes down to what features matter to the individual buyer. On the Altima we liked the comfy seats, and the interior layout was much more practical. Radio miles better than Accord's, that still bothers me. I did think it was sharper looking too. Accord pros: Although it is technically larger, it felt and drove like a smaller car. Firmer handling and ride (we drove the EX-L CVT). Backup camera standard whereas you had to buy the nav to get it on the Altima. The CVT is so much quieter on the Accord; we decided that the whine of the Altima's on start-up would become more annoying over time, not less. Mileage pretty much the same. But we have friends with Altimas and they love them."
backy,Jan-15,"Over the holidays I made a cross-country trip with my family in our 2013 Sonata GLS. I kept track of fuel and miles. Overall we drove 3100 miles on 86.9 gallons (price range $1.879 to $2.029 a gallon! ), for 35.7 mpg. I was pleasantly surprised by the overall FE, given that only 2400 of the 3100 miles were long distance highway/freeway driving, and the rest was urban/suburban/rural driving. Temps were 30s to 50s on the outbound trip, 30s to low 70s at the destination, and 40s to around 0 on the return leg. 3 people in the car with a full trunk. The 2400 miles of highway/freeway driving were mostly between 65 and 77 mph, with long stretches over 75 mph. I noticed a significant decrease in FE going from 65 mph, when the car did upper 30s mpg, to 75+ mph, when it did well to hit 35 mpg. I also noticed FE on the last day, when temps fell from about 20 to near 0, was a lot worse than the day before, when they were mostly in the 40s. Wind was a factor also. We had a slight headwind on the outbound trip, and a very stiff headwind (near 40 mph) during much of the return trip.

I also found the car was a comfortable highway cruiser, even with 10 hours a day behind the wheel. The driver's seat has firm cushions, but power adjustments for height, recline, and lumbar, and I found it very comfortable. I spent some time in the front passenger seat and found that comfortable also, albeit with fewer adjustments than the driver's seat. The car had a smooth ride on the highway and was pretty quiet, with the engine turning only a bit over 2000 rpms at 75 mph.

The most appreciated features on the car were the USB/iPod connector, for charging iPhones and playing my daughter's playlist, and the heated front seats. And the big trunk was a plus too!"
stickguy,Jan-15,"good write up. A lot of the same features I liked on my 2015. Very comfortable seats. Plus on the lmited, a nicely adjustable power passenger seat. I rarely ride there, but did this trip when more daughter drove for a 3 hour stint. Too many cars IMO have a passenger seat that is way too low and sloped down.

the nice low revs at cruising speed is also a bonus. I really found the BLIS to be a nice feature to have."

While I see at least 25 current model Altima's daily, and at least that many Accords too...the Altima somehow looks ""chintzy"". It's got one too many pieces of chrome-stick on the exterior, I have heard the unpleasant full throttle drone of the engine and exhaust right next to my car at various times and speeds. It is certainly a handsome car...but I would never, ever, consider buying one. From the get-go; when it first came out, I was like ""meh"".

Now the Accord on the other hand was done right. It has a quality I cannot put into words that make me say ""now that is a nice car"". If it and the new Mazda 6 were available when I was car shopping in late December 2011 I think the Accord Sport and the Mazda 6 Touring would be battling it out for my parking Spot."

I don't understand the Altima's popularity either. Pushes none of my buttons.

The Mazda 6 is a darling for auto journos, but it presents itself in the market a sa more expensive car than the usual suspects and leaves some with the impression it needs more power. I haven't driven one so I cannot say. Mazda's dealer network is also relatively small by comparison."
brian125,Jan-15,Mazda6 is a sporty car lost in the family sedan segment. I said this before and I'll say it again. Mazda should take this model put some real zoom zoom under the hood and go after the younger buyers. Offer two models with upgraded engines. The majority of family sedan buyers could care less about buying a mazda6. I think 53k units sold ytd speaks for itself.
backy,Jan-15,"How many people, if told 10 years ago, ""Ten years from now, Hyundai/Kia will sell nearly as many mid-sized cars in the USA as Honda sells Accords"", would have laughed their heads off and referred the person to a psychiatrist?

The other thing these sales numbers remind us of is that ""popularity, a winning start, is not the last test of good art."""

Good point.  There's a lot of buyers out there who do little research and shop solely on looks, a short test drive, and price.  May be lots of Altima buyers there."

I've rented both the new Altima and new Sonata, and for me, it's Altima hands down--if I evaluate ALL the features and not cherry-pick one advantage point over another I mean. I like the Sonata engine better for instance.

My thought as well. Hyundai/Kia takes third place if you combine the fraternal twins. (I suppose they're a little less obvious than Chevy/GMC, but we all know it's the same car underneath.)

Re: Altima, I'm not surprised it sells well. Anecdotally, two friends have liked theirs very much. And the top trim SL I sat in at the auto show had very nice interior materials. And it's got a lot of leg room. It's made the Maxima entirely pointless. The base model has unfortunate ""mouse fur"" fabric, like the base Accord. But on the whole: good price, good fuel economy, lots of space, good reputation for reliability, built in the USA. If my left leg fell off and I was forced to drive an automatic, it'd be high on my list."
wayne21,Jan-15,"Well...... we bought our first ever Nissan. We went with the Altima 3.5SL. We still have our 2010 venza, but will likely sell it soon. If we sell it it will be the first time since 1990 that we didn't have a Toyota or Honda product in our garage. We went with Nissan because we were tired of cheap interiors on Toyotas. I also thought that although they have a great drivetrain they continue to remain about 5 years behind in technology. When we looked at the 2015 camry we wrote it off immediately. We'd rented fusions on a number of occasions and didn't care much for them. I was not remotely interested in a GM or Fiat (formerly Chrysler) for personal reasons. Having had a 2000 accord with the original plus three replacement transmissions - and lots of wind noise - we wrote off Honda. We haven't looked back yet."
backy,Jan-15,"I got to drive a couple of mid-sizers I haven't driven before this week, due to a service loaner and a rental. First, I got a brand-new (200 miles) 200 Limited that seemed to have all the bells and whistles--nav, leather, panoramic moonroof etc. It drove fine; steering felt a bit disconnected but was OK for EPS. Ride was good, but no better than on my 2013 Sonata GLS (designed over five years ago). The push-button start and keyless entry was kinda nice, but a couple of things annoyed me. First, it took me 15 minutes to find the bun warmer controls. Turned out they were in the touchscreen, under ""Controls"". In fact, a lot of functions were controlled by the touchscreen--which was tricky to use wearing warm gloves (it was below zero that day). Second, I didn't like the rotary shifter. I prefer the more physical action of a shift lever. Also, the car didn't have a manual shift option--which would have been handy since the 9-speed tranny did a lot of hunting for the right gear. Also, it felt as if I were sitting in a bathtub--and the seat was raised! The feeling was amplified when I picked up the 2008 Mazda6 that I had brought in for warranty work, and I noticed how much more airy the cabin felt. I didn't sit in the back of the 200 but it looked claustrophobic back there. So, not a car I'd buy.

Then I got to drive the current-gen Optima LX courtesy of Hertz this week. It wasn't brand-new, in fact had 45k miles on it. I took it on a 170-mile round trip, mostly highway driving at around 65 mph. It was a very cold day--below zero when I picked up the car, and a high of 10. It drove much like my wife's 2013 Sonata, maybe a little firmer ride but hard to tell since it was so cold. It was a basic car with manual driver's seat, but I was able to adjust it for comfort although I felt as if I were sitting pretty low. I liked the controls and displays, simple to navigate, although some of the switchgear (e.g. plastic surrounds on steering wheel controls, radio dials) were already loosening up. Worse, there was already a hole worn into the left side of the driver's seat, near the seatback. The material did feel thin, compared to my wife's Sonata. But rental cars get hard use and 45k is a lot of miles for a rental. On the plus side, the car felt solid after all those miles, with only one slight rattle that seemed to be coming from the driver's side A pillar and could have been due to the cold. I got about 31 mpg on the trip, not bad at all considering the cold weather and the stiff headwind/crosswind I had for much of the trip. I much preferred the Optima to the newer 200, although I did like those bun warmers on the 200 (my wife's Sonata has those too). I'm not a big fan of tech gizmos on cars, and touch screens. But then, my first car ('66 Coronet) lacked carpeting, power steering (or power anything else except brakes), and a radio, and I managed somehow."
ctl,Jan-15,Altima V6... what was your take on Avalon wayne21?
wayne21,Jan-15,"ctl said:

Actually, I test drove a number of vehicles. The other two cars I really considered were the avalon and the genesis sedan (I wrote off the maxima due to its poor crash ratings for the front seat passenger). I thought the avalon had a pretty choppy ride and the genesis was Hyundai's version of the crown vic or LTD. Just one opinion."

I don't put much stock in CR input unless it is from surveys from owners. My most recent purchase based on CR was the ""top rated elliptical under $2,000"". It isn't anything to write home about. The first one (set up in my home by the distributor) clunked horribly within 2 uses and was difficult to use. The replacement clunks and isn't any more fun to use. My old one ($700) was used daily for 1 hour over a 7 year period before a bearing started going out of it. It was FAR better than the ""top rated CR"" elliptical. As to the ""value"" I am not really worried about it. I got tired of cheap Toyota interiors and noisy Hondas with transmission problems. I have no idea what the future holds for our 6 cyl Altima, but I plan to keep it for a long time. I usually keep a car for 5 to 10 years. I haven't sold or traded a car in over 20 years - 1 car was given to my son and the others were donated."

Why, if he'd saved that $1,500 a year, he could have saved enough to rebuild out of his own pocket in just a couple hundred years!I kid. It's true, insurance is intended for uncertain catastrophes. Maintenance and care (home, auto, or health) are not ""insurance"". You don't expect your car insurance to pay for new tires, nor your homeowners insurance to pay for mowing the grass, and you shouldn't expect your health insurance to pay for... well, I'll step back from that ledge before I alienate the entire forum.Does a buying a $750 warranty for maybe $2-3K worth of repairs, maybe $0 worth of repairs, make sense?... Not really. Which is why I declined it three times before the marginal monthly payment increase was so small I briefly lost touch with my left brain and went for it. And ya know, I'm still glad it's there. Though I have the savings on hand to handle a transmission or electrical problem, when you begin to think in terms of $15 a month, your inner Dave Ramsey gets the boot. They are very good at selling the stupid things. And don't we all upsell something in our jobs? If I couldn't talk people into bells and whistles now and then, my kids would be hungry.Good luck trying to get an insurance company to pay for a big claim.

akirby,Jan-15,"I've had two totaled vehicles (kids not mine) with Geico. They totaled a 6 month old 2012 Focus after my daughter failed to stop in time and rear ended another car. The engine looked ok but they totaled it anyway and gave me full replacement value. My son had a 7 yr old Focus we paid $16K for. He spun out on ice and they wrote him a check for $8K. Our roof had wind and hail damage. State farm wrote a check for that which allowed us to get better shingles with nothing out of pocket no questions asked.

Maybe you have the wrong insurance companies."
brian125,Jan-15,"Allstate paid out plenty of money for my 3 kids over the years till they drop me. Both my boys totaled or wrecked there cars once. My daughter nickeled and dimmed State farm with her little crashes her first 3 yrs of driving. Funny thing Its never there fault.

My wife and I have Geico Ins. Nothing but high praise for them. Geico has excellent rates for good drivers."
andres3,Jan-15,"brian125 said:

Geico is professional, and overall probably a ""good"" insurance company. That doesn't stop them from trying to be cheap and ""overlook"" slight defects on a brand new vehicle that sustained 22K in damage. They originally estimated $15K, so that shows incompetence in the first estimate (or trying to get away with murder).

A good example is I had a brand new S4, and one of the tires came in out of balance. It's Quattro AWD. The manual recommends changing all 4 tires at the same time, but under no circumstance a minimum of 2 tires on the same axle. Geico wanted to replace the one tire. I had to do a lot of hooting and hollering, arguing, phone calls, nasty letter, and they finally only compromised at doing 2 tires, and making me pay 20% for both of them for ""betterment"" since 20% of the tread was used on the old tires.

Geico's not that good. They are cheap, and you get good cheap insurance for that cheapness. But know there's a reason they are cheap. As long as they let you know ahead of time they will nickel and dime you, that's OK, but they don't advertise the nickel and dime part of their policy.

Also, for some reason they fight people on Diminished value, thought my policy specifically excludes it, they told me they fight 3rd parties that claim it against them as well. There is no reason to fight DV, insurance companies need to get into the real world."
brian125,Jan-15,"I know Ins companies are trying to replace original parts and equipment using after market parts these days. Geico/ liberty mutual to name a few.

Overall with my wife's accident 3 years ago causing 15k in damage not @akirby accident I was more than happy how Geico handled my accident and fixed vehicle. In todays times Ins. companies try to put the blame on both parties if they could. Ins. companies will try to weasel out of paying what is owed to you . You have to fight them . That's why its important to have a good Autobody shop in the event of a accident .

If I get into a Accident My car is at that Autobody shop days before the Ins. adjuster gets there. Read between the lines here. Ins. is not getting over on me.

If someone hits me in my vehicle who is fully insured and I do not have collision the ins company will try to access blame on me to. People who got into a few accidents may have experience this kind of blame game today.

In NYC... Taxi companies INS. are notorious for trying to pin blame on the other driver as well in accidents with there vehicles."

My response:

Well, Homer Simpson is a ""Safety Manager"" I actually owned a Fiat. 79 Strata. I was 16, my neighbor had a running car, and I had $300 bucks. Nothing worked on it except the engine, which never failed me... so that was good.
I will give you an example of quality back then. I ordered new widow cranks from Italy since their dealer network collapsed. It took 2 months. I could then remove the lock-tite wrench that stood in and excitedly installed the new cranks. 1st crank and it Broke in half. So, I tried the other one..... same result after 4 very careful cranks. I ended up drilling holes in the floor so the water would drain, and left the damn things down until I scrapped it. The good news is that the junkyard gave me $500. So, pocketed $200 after a 16 year old punished it for 25k.

So, Fiat-Chrysler have their work cut out for them if they are ever going to be seen as quality, long lasting products."

I hammered it getting on the local brand new, just paved, super-wide parkway and I can confirm it feels like 310hp and 320 lb Ft. The salesperson was frightened. I was smiling from ear to ear. The ergonomics suck. Obtuse even. Lots of flat, identical buttons on the center console.

As for the mustang egronomics - must be a personal preference thing as every reviewer has praised the interior materials and layout."
[Deleted User],Feb-15,"The materials were great. No problem there. Also, reviewers have hours or days with the car. I had 1/2 hour. Also, it was a stick, so I was concentrating (it has been a while). I will stick to my test drive testimony.... and also take in account that I drove the base 2.3EB. It had a small screen (with a backup camera) and surrounding that screen were about 12 flat buttons the size of a keyboard that were all the exact same size and dead flat. I can feel out my cars controls by touch, therefore keeping my eyes on the road. Sorry, but the BASE CAR ergonomics are not good IMHO.

Again, I had little time to acclimate myself with the controls, but still the power window buttons were in a weird place, and I had no idea what the toggle switches did. Also, the climate controls were small and at a glance non decipherable One item I do want to share is that brake feel was AWESOME. For 25k, you get a BMW 328 killer that will match it move for move. Hard to resist. SO, all the basics are there. Handling, engine, steering feel, and confidence inspiring brakes. Great car."
benjaminh,Feb-15,"Well, cski and I, both long-time members of this forum, seem to have straying eyes for cars other than the ones we're married too lol. He's flirting with a Mustang, while I'm beginning to think about the new 2016 Acura ILX. The 2015 and earlier ILX was a bit of a slow poke when it came to performance, but the 2016 ILX gets the direct-injected 2.4 from the larger TLX, plus it also gets Acura's new 8 speed dual clutch transmission with the exclusive torque converter. Since the ILX weighs c. 500 pounds less than the TLX, putting the same engine in it should make it a fairly impressive performer. It wouldn't beat that Mustang, but it would likely beat any other 4 cylinder midsize car. 0-60 might be as fast as 6 seconds with the 2016 ILX, although that's not really known yet.

My problem, however, is that my current drive, a 2008 Accord EVL navi 5MT, has nothing wrong with it. And really, I still pretty much love my current drive. But at some point, when it comes time to replace the ""while whale"" as I call her, I might give the ILX consideration. Now that one of my kids is off at college, and since my wife has a 2013 Accord, I'm not sure I need a midsize anymore....Mostly I'm just driving back and forth to work by myself."
stickguy,Feb-15,"I agree on the ILX. I always liked the package (style, interior) but only took a brief test drive. From seeing what they are doing to it, it sounds like a nice upgrade. Plenty of engine, nice trans, and interesting features. Of course, it always comes down to price too!"
benjaminh,Feb-15,"The rumor is that Acura is going to have a small price increase on the 2016 ILX, even with all the upgrades. But I'll believe it when I see it. I still have my HondaCare extended warranty on my Accord until the end of the year, and so that's the soonest I'll be make a trade in any case. Since my Accord only has c. 72k miles on it, and fairly recent tires, I could likely keep it going for another 3 years and 30,000 miles with mostly just oil changes...."
stickguy,Feb-15,"with all the upgrades and new content, if they keep the price increase to a minimal amount it will be a much more competitive package. And even undercut the TLX a bit."
dudleyr,Feb-15,"Skip the ILX and just get another Accord. Basically the same engine. The new Accord engine is way underrated and dynos at almost the rated hp and has the same torque as the TLX I4. The Accord also has way more room inside and rides and handles just as well (or better) than the ILX.

The ILX just seems like a tarted up Civic to me, and I don't think it will be anywhere near 6.0 to 60."

nyccarguy,Feb-15,"We got another decent snow storm today. I was really able to get a feel for the Legacy's AWD system and see what all the hype is about. I backed out of the garage and could feel the car sink into the deep, wet, snow. Pulling out of my driveway & onto my unplowed street was a snap. The streets were plowed, but snow covered. I could really feel all 4 wheels working as they transferred power from front to back & side to side. Even the interstates were in terrible shape. I was able to pull into & out of snow covered lanes without incident. The Legacy felt very stable & secure. When I got to work, there was a line to et into the parking lot. So I parallel parked the car in an unplowed snow embankment. Then snow turned to ice & the NYC plow trucks made a few passes. Parked in snow & ice up half way up its wheels, I was able to pull out of the spot as if it were a beautiful, sunny day. Tonight I was able to have fun with the Legacy on the side roads. 7K miles & I'm really impressed.

I had to pick my 8 year old son up from hockey practice tonight after work. The ice rink shares a parking lot with one of the city's beaches which means they just plow the 1st 2 rows of spots. Afterwards I said to him, you want to see something cool? He responded: ""Subies Power?""

The Legacy drove through about a foot of unplowed, thick, snow without even flinching. I really dig this car."

So I figured, what the hay? I strolled into a dealership on my way home from work one day, test drove the BMW, & fell madly in love with a car that I had lusted after since 1995. The only thing I had left to do was find my ideal leftover 2011 328xi & get the most I could for my trade. Done and done. Oh, and I ""pulled out all the stops"" convincing my wife that I ""needed"" the car."

I can so relate. Never owned a BMW but seriously considered a 3 series 2 door back in '94. I really wanted the 325, but the cost difference from the 318 was significant. I test drove the 318 with manual and it didn't feel any quicker than the Mercury Tracer LTS I was driving. It had the Mazda based DOHC engine instead of the standard Ford Escort based engine. Ended up with a black with black leather 95 Jetta GLX with a 5sp, and VR6 for less than a base 318. Yes, I know, not apples to apples. That was when I was single, and my wife will not consider a BMW, Volvo, or MB. She jokes that they all can be found parked leaking pink stuff. I haven't given up yet.."
roadburner,Feb-15,"My CCBA affliction must be wearing off- aside from a couple of Challenger SRTs NOTHING I've looked at lights my fire anymore. My BMW dealer even traded for a 2011 Alpine White/Coral Red M Sport 135i and I was underwhelmed. I spent 20 minutes in the showroom trying to will myself to like it but no joy. And on top of all this my lovely wife keeps encouraging me-telling me that it's my turn to get a car, since she and my son got their current rides a couple of years ago. I wish I had not tweaked the Mazdaspeed at all- I now like it so much that most everything else seems dull and anodyne- especially the new BMWs(M235i and M3/4 excluded)."
stickguy,Feb-15,"well RB if you are happy as a pig in slop with your current ride, then why bother to look? Might as well wait until it gives you a reason to, or something new pops up (the next speed3?) that gets you off the sidelines.

The Contour you asked? well, I actually had 2. the first was actually a Mystique. a 1995 (first year). top of the line model with a V6 and 5 speed. That was a fun car. Well made, high quality interior. Quick and sporty. real nice package. Did eat a couple of catalysts though. Other than that, it was fine.

the sons car was a 1999 (or 2000?) that we got in 2008. had about 90K on it. And I think a hard life. Ran OK. didn't look bad. trans shifted kind of hard at times. But it really seemed like a cheap, cheesy car that just did not drive well. Slow dog. essence of rental car (and this was an SE with nice alloys!). really seemed like a totally different car. I rarely drove it because I did not like it. Son did not either, but it beat walking! Needless to say, he was very happy when I bought my sisters Acura TL 8 months later for him to use. That car, he liked!"

if I ever have some disposable income (not being disposed of at a college...) and get a better garage/parking arrangement (meaning, I move someplace cheaper!) I still want to have a toy. though after getting in and out of some sports cars at the car show, it is more likely going to be a pickup or a Wrangler, so I can get in and out of it!"
roadburner,Feb-15,I'm going to drive a few cars to see if I can be swayed-I still like looking-but there's not much out there that interests me. I really wish Mazda would build a Miata Coupe with at least 250 hp under the hood- that would be perfect.

backy,Feb-15,"Re the Contour... I leased a '95 Mystake... er, Mystique, base model. I liked its styling better than the Contour's. One reason I got it was because at the time it was one of the few mid-sized family cars you could get with a stick and ABS/traction without getting an uplevel trim. I guess now it would be considered a compact. I really liked how it drove... when it wasn't at the dealer for one recall/problem or another. It was a 2-year lease and at one point I added up the weeks it was not in my possession, but I forgot. Shame on me for getting a new design in its first year.

RWD! TURBO! 6-SPEED MANUAL (although living where you do, I wouldn't fault you for going with an automatic)!"
ahightower,Feb-15,"Thought I'd give a little update on my car, a 2013 Accord Sport 6MT at 20,500 miles.

Fuel economy:
I've used the fuelly app since purchased new in June 2013. 56 fill-ups resulting in...
Best mpg: 31.3
Avg mpg: 27.8
This is not overly impressive given the advertised claims, but it's been basically a commuter, not a long distance cruiser. My commute decreased from 25 to 9 miles each way last April, and the avg took a hit. I simultaneously quit caring about FE because I only fill up every three weeks, and I almost never use the ECON button as I just prefer the more responsive throttle and full-blast AC. And I suppose the two or three long (200+ miles) highway trips I've taken were at somewhat higher speeds. I've seen the trip computer as high as 40 on medium distance 60ish mph jaunts, but the whole tank never ends up that high.

Reliability:
Perfect. Have had two oil changes and two tire patches. Changed the cabin air filter and cannot believe how simple it is compared to my previous car, a 2008 Mazda3 (i Touring 5MT). It's holding up very well, as I'd expect from a new car. Still tight as a drum, no squeaks or rattles. The driver's floor mat is a piece of s***, started to wear a hole through with the right heel in the first few months, ended up getting a heavy duty rubber floormat (from a Freightliner truck!) to lay over it and we're good now. Otherwise, no complaints.

Favorite features:
-All the little things that set the Sport apart from the LX still make me look back as I walk away. The wheels, the spoiler, the exhaust tips. The upgraded cloth interior is very durable. The leather-wrapped wheel and shift knob.
-Love the automatic climate control (a small luxury that makes a big difference), and the AC really kicks when it's hot - my old Mazda just wasn't up to the task of 100+ degree Texas summers.
-The rear-view camera is really useful.
-The *perfect* manual transmission, something to look forward to every day. Hill-holding feature, while of course I am an excellent driver and got really good with the footwork and/or the handbrake in my last car, it's quite nice to just let off the brake and know you're not going to meet the darn Escalade that's practically kissing your bumper. (BACK OFF, LADY!)
-Still appreciate all the leg room up front for me, and in back even with my seat nearly all the way back. We have three boys who fit comfortably enough three-across the back, so we often take my car to save fuel and lease miles on her SUV.

Mild disappointments:
-The stereo's sound quality is fine but not ""good"", and
-it quit displaying my iphone's text messages about three software updates ago.

Would I buy it again?:
Absolutely. It looks and feels much more expensive than it really was, and it's the perfect balance of comfort and sport. And it's going to make a great first car for the boys in a few years."
nyccarguy,Feb-15,"@ahightower‌

Nice write up. I'm glad you are happy with the car.

Fuel economy is far from the top of my ""must have"" list when I'm car shopping. I commute 65 miles round trip, 6 days a week. I keep track of it on fuelly just because I think it is cool. The cold weather we've been experiencing here in the North East has wreaked havoc on my Legacy's FE numbers. Why? Because I start the car up and let it idle in my driveway for at least 10 minutes every morning. Over close to 8,000 miles (Since September 27, 2014) I am averaging 25.6 MPG. My last 4 fill ups have been 22.7, 25.2, 22.2, & 23.9.

I too am very happy with my Legacy. It is a beast in the snow."
robr2,Feb-15,"nyccarguy said:

Other than wanting a warm car, letting it idle that long doesn't help the car. Your best best bet is to start it up, let the idle drop down (30 seconds or so) and then go light on it until it reaches operating temp."

That's the ONLY reason I do it, to have a warm car."
suydam,Feb-15,"I have a 2013 Accord EX-L and I love it too. I would agree with your assessment in nearly every way. Fuel economy is important to me, and I'm averaging 27-8 around town and 32-3 highway in this bitter winter weather we are having, much better in warmer weather. I also love the comfortable seats and the ease of driving it pretty much anywhere. Agree about the stereo. Unlike almost every reviewer I actually like the touch screen and find it very easy to use. I'm now sold on both backup camera and push button start and can't imagine getting a vehicle without them. Only been to the dealer twice for routine maintenance in 2 years. It's a great car."
explorerx4,Feb-15,"My Fusion sits in the garage, so I just start it and go in the morning. The Escape sits outside, so I start it, put the defroster on max, get the heated seats going, and then scrape the glass and bring the newspaper in the house.
Took it to the car wash for the first time today. Kind of missed the temperature window by a few minutes, so I stole my wife's spot in the garage for a while to let it dry out. At least now I can see the real color on the hood."

Great review!
cski says:

Audio system fix:

Back in the day all Accords had four, 6 1/2"" paper speakers. Just remove and keep those, then add 4 kicker or Infinity Kappa 2 speakers with at least 60 watt RMS power handling. It will vastly improve your sound system.(the aftermarket car audio market has taken a huge hit due to integrated phone, camera, Bluetooth, and Pandora on stock head units that are also integrated on the steering wheel.) So,even Luxury brand speakers are cheap and very good quality. On a lease car I would just add a subwoofer and remove it when you turn in the car, and not even mess with any of the stock interior speakers. I would never swap out a head unit these days on any decent mid size to entry level luxury car . The stock look is the best look, and keeps thieves away.

I love the Sport. I still look back at my Kia EX all the time, but I also admit I look back when I see a Honda Accord Sport too. I wish you could get it in that nice blue color with the stick, but black cars are still ""in"" now. Gray makes me sad. lol.

Fuel Economy. I fill up once every two weeks, but the neat thing is that I bought an App for $2.99 called the AASpeed-meter. It offers me huge LCD digits in any color I want, kind of like a heads up display. It also includes an enhanced Google GPS system that is more sharp and 3-D. Now I use my cruise control all the time, and my F/E has increased dramatically. I am getting 24 to 25 mpg in combined driving city/highway/suburbia. It was speeding tickets because of the way my hand blocks my speedometer, which is buried too far back in the pod and hard to read beacuse it has too many hash-marks, and I need progressive lenses. I cant see how fast I am going quickly enough. I have to take my eyes off the road....where they should be. I really love the app. Available at Google Play."

brian125,Feb-15,"I'm still not totally sold on CVT's. Honda's CVT is excellent and much better than Nissan's.

CVT's currently have longevity issues with high horsepower \ torque engines. Actually modern automatics are much simpler than the older units. Mostly because the electronic brains are ""simpler"" than the older hydraulic controllers. That is the main reason the 8 and 9 gear transmissions are ""possible"" while being lighter and smaller than older 4 speeds. Cvt's are cheaper to build."

I think so too. After having a 6S GT with the v6, there's no way I could settle with their current offering. That's the only car I ever had that I would take out for a ride if I woke up in the middle of the night.I figured it must have been just me, but I asked a friend who sells cars what percentage of people buy a car without asking about the engine.

When we test drove the Outback 3.6 a week or so ago, I don't think my wife noticed that it was a CVT, even though the salesman told her. It has paddle shifters on the steering wheel to up/down shift, rather than using the shift lever, as she's used to."

My 2013 with nearly 34k has required nothing more than regular maintenance. Though I would have preferred Michelins, the GoodYear assurance fuel max tires ride smoothly and seem to be lasting. Currently have between 6-7/32 and are wearing evenly. The CVT is ok. I like how smooth and seamless it is in slow moving traffic and how it progressively adjusts when driving up and down grades. That is really nice on interstate drives, no constant down and up shifts as I try to maintain a steady speed. It also seems responsive enough. If you floor it it quickly kicks down to a lower ratio. What I've been especially impressed with is how quickly it accelerates 45-70 and above. Makes merging and passing fun! I have also found that I can eliminate that CVT drone by lightly letting up on the accelerator, it quickly moves up (simulated shift, revs drop) and then continue accelerating. Because my drive of 40+ miles each way 5 days a week, ny car guy has me beat here, is roughly 70% highway driving 60-75mph, my gas mileage has stayed above 34 mpg. I sometimes see 40 mpg on single drives. I think the CVT has been a plus here. Very pleased so far."

akirby,Feb-15,"berri said:


Mulally was running the company at that time so you can't just blame Fields. I think Ford simply got too aggressive with cost cutting after near bankruptcy. They also got too aggressive with mpg targets which is why they used the powershift DCT on the Focus and Fiesta which has been problematic. My Ford Touch was a fiasco because they chose the wrong company to build it and they failed - and Ford didn't have a backup plan for the 2011 Edge where it debuted so they were stuck with a bad choice and a terrible choice. The other problem was trying to adapt European platforms like Focus, Kuga and Mondeo to North American production which caused problems when launching the Focus, Escape and Fusion.

I think most of those problems are now behind them. They're hiring again to fill in the gaps from the cost cutting. The global platforms are now in place and MFT is being replaced with Sync 3. We're also seeing the second generation of ecoboost engines which appear to be much better than the first gen.

If you stop and think about how many new platforms and new vehicles and new engines/drivetrains Ford has put out the last few years it's no wonder they had some teething problems. If we don't see improvements over the next 2-3 years then I'll get worried. But not yet."
benjaminh,Feb-15,"In my local paper yesterday, there were ads for the following midsize cars for $19.5 k or less: 2015 Passat 1.8T, 2015 Altima, 2015 Fusion, 2015 Camry. Those are all good cars at very good prices. Which one would you get? I'd be tempted to test drive the Passat with its new turbo engine, but VW and reliability are two words that don't always go together. Had an Altima recently as a rental, and was mixed about it. The Fusion looks good, but the base engine is rather a dog. And, for all of those cars mentioned so far, the rear visibility is only so so. The new Camry looks like it's scowling, but it is improved in several ways, and is made in my home state. Hard to beat that price. Shocking, but I might go with the Camry. Of course, for probably $500 or so more I could have an Accord, and so I'd probably go with that, given that I'm a Honda fan. But shockingly now the Camry comes second for me. And the value is hard to beat."
stickguy,Feb-15,"if they were all base models, probably the camry too. Though I would give the Passat a look.

the Altima, I consider that a cheap lease if you need a cheap beater option.

Camry is a good deal. they added quite a bit of content to the base cars (at least the LE, not sure if there is a strippo model below it). Good car to get for a kid."
roadburner,Feb-15,"If I was in that market the only cars I would consider are the Accord Sport and Mazda6. To my eyes the Passat has been ""Americanized"" into a Camry with slight Germanic overtones- and I don't mean that as a compliment."

The Accord sport is nice. You would like it with a stick. No moonroof, and very light on any options (basically no safety tech outside of a backup camera). Not blind spot monitoring, and it lets you wander around lanes and run into cars in front of you to your hearts content.

I did try to buy one, but the dealer that had some left drove us away. That was the CVT. worked pretty well in that car. I never drove the stick version, but I am sure I would have liked it."
brian125,Feb-15,"Without test driving the Fusion and Sonata my List would not be 100% accurate.

I was impressed with the 2015 Passat. I test drove the top model . If I were a smaller guy this would be my #1 choice hands down.


1- Altima.........most interior room in this group. Not so much the best vehicle.. but my #1 cause of it. Excellent MPG
-
2- Passat/ Fusion ... Fusion only vehicle in this group offering back up camera on base. Both vehicles offer nice ride and handling. Passat was very quiet inside the vehicle. But then again I was not driving a 1.8T engine .

4- Camry...Quiet and softer ride even thou it failed the overlap test (still would not buy) not a bad beater vehicle.

The 2015 Sonata is definitely worth a look in this class. Lot of buyers like the new sonata. I'm sure @stickguy can give us his feedback on his Sonata."

I think a lot of people are still judging based on the prior generation. Having looked at both back to back, I think the 2015 blows the 2014 away overall."

Mazda6 doesn't have much in the way of incentives, nor does the Legacy although both are fine cars. The Altima, Malibu, Camry don't turn me on. There's very good deals available on Fusions and Passats so I'd have to consider those if I were shopping for a mid-sizer.

Anyway, I might well be in the market then, and although I can afford a higher end and loaded up midsize car, and maybe even an Acura TLX, I'm considering getting one of these ""bargain"" base models. There are a lot of features that back in 2008 were only on the high end Accords that are standard on the LX now, like dual zone climate control, bluetooth, alloy wheels, etc. If the Edmunds price tool is right, the trade in value of my 08 might be c. $10k, and then if I can snag a new LX for c. 20k, I'd be out just 10k plus TTL and into a new car. Hmmm. But the Sport model is tempting, as is the EX, and I love navi, and at that point maybe I could try an Acura ILX, even though it's a bit smaller....Decisions, decisions."

brian125,Mar-15,"Looked at my new CR reports. The 2015 Subaru legacy is there top choice midsizer. The Impreza faired very well to. When I was in the dealership last week I sat in both vehicles. Impreza had a nice interior lay out, good head rm . for a small car. The Legacy was impressive with a nice upscale feel inside with plenty of room . Sharp looking exterior. Subaru's whole line up offers nice quality vehicles.

I did manage to test drive the Outback 3.6R which is on the legacy platform. Very nice all around vehicle . The CVT shifted effortlessly, its 256 hp seemed like a well balance of power, inside the cabin was well isolated. Everything in the Outback felt right and well placed. Its upscale look and layout inside was a surprise . My only knock was a combined 22 mpg's. Visibility is very good in this crossover. Subaru's Eye sight and Cross traffic braking are two top features we all should want in our new vehicles today . If your a family guy this Outback should be on your short list. Nice job................. Subaru"

Thanks for the quick review and affirmation. The wife is loving her new Outback 3.6R that we picked up on Saturday. She calls it a luxury car without the luxury badge.

I'm OK with the mileage; the Mazda we traded in got 17/23 and required premium fuel. The Outback gets 20/27 and uses regular unleaded."

Comparison:
The Big Test: 2014/2015 Midsize Sedans
Chevrolet Malibu vs. Chrysler 200 vs. Honda Accord vs. Kia Optima vs. Mazda6 vs. Nissan Altima
By Rory Jurnecka | Photos By William Walker | From the July 2014 issue of Motor Trend
Again, the Mazda pushed through the group to impress everyone who drove it. With second-best acceleration, a sweet-sounding engine, and lever-actuated manual gear selection, the Mazda proved a favorite. As Kong put it, ""The powertrain is the best here, the auto shifts up and down quickly, and the engine never feels like it's wanting for more."" Martinez concurred, ""The 2.5-liter SkyActiv pulls smoothly and sounds great."" The Mazda provided an engaging powertrain, rather than one that just gets the job done. Lieberman summed it up best: ""If Americans actually cared about driving, the Mazda6 would be the best-selling car in the U.S.""
Winner : the Mazda6. When we asked ourselves which vehicle we'd purchase with our own money, we unanimously voted for the Mazda. Its combination of good looks, strong fuel economy, excellent road manners, roomy rear seat, and engaging powertrain give the Mazda the one element that all its competitors seem to lack: a real personality. In a beige-and-taupe segment, the Mazda adds a big splash of red. And that's something we wish more automakers would achieve.

roadburner,Mar-15,Mazda definitely knows how to build a sweet driving car for a relatively low price. The only car that comes even close to the Mazda6 is the Accord Sport. I love my 2007 Mazdaspeed 3 and I continue to hope that Mazdaspeed versions of the 6 and 3 are forthcoming.
brian125,Mar-15,"Most reviews will tell you the mazda6 is the next coming of Christ. 6 sales and the family buyers tell a different story here. Mazda6 cant compete in this segment with the mighty Camry and Accords labeled as family cars.

Chevy, Kia, Hyundai, Ford also hurt Mazda sales with there deep discounts. The Chrysler 200 is almost tripling mazda6 sales every month.



I like the mazda6 but like most in here passed on buying one. Mazda6 Handles great , No upgrade motor, to much road noise, smaller cabin and back seat than Accord and others. Maybe its more the design inside the 6. Upgrade models have no Zoom Zoom for the money . I test drove it last year and the negatives outweigh the positives. There is a reason why Mazda barley sells 5k units a month.

If Mazda wanted to make money on there mazda6 they should strip the family sedan label and go after the entry level sports sedan buyer. Family buyers show little interest in this vehicle.

I like what Buick did with there Regal."
akirby,Mar-15,"Fusion has been in production since 2005 with long term reliability on par with Camry and Accord. There were launch problems with the 2013s due to the changeover to a European platform and suppliers but those were short term problems that won't reoccur once fixed under warranty. They had a few hiccups like the PTUs on AWD vehicles but most problems are simple bad parts or engineering problems that get corrected.

Virtually all engines from all mfrs now easily last 150K and longer and you just don't get the rattles after a few years like you used to. Even the worst vehicles are pretty solid now."

http://oxmoormazda.com/New-2015-Mazda-Mazda6-i-Sport-Louisville-KY/vd/23679751

It's a lot of car for the money. Probably the least expensive Honda Accord LX 6 MT would cost about $500 or so more. The Mazda 6 a very nice car, and the automotive press certainly likes it, but I think the Accord is a better car.

The Mazda6 is supposed to be sporty, but even with the manual transmission it gets to 60 in a rather unimpressive 7.9 seconds by C & D's test. As they say:

""Hitched up to the six-speed manual, the 2.5 drives the 6 to 60 mph in 7.9 seconds. A four-cylinder Accord manual does it in 6.6 seconds in second gear, whereas the Mazda requires two upshifts. By the quarter-mile, the 6 is a second behind the Accord. In short, the Skyactiv isn’t very active, and it won’t win you many drag races, even against other family sedans.""

http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2014-mazda-6-i-sport-test-review-the-gearbox-of-an-rx-8-page-2

6.6 seconds is class leading when it comes to base family sedans. The Mazda6 is one of the slowest iirc. More than a second faster in acceleration is worth $500 to me right there, but the Accord offers a lot more standard that the 6 doesn't have, like:

alloy wheels
dual zone climate control
back up camera
1 cubic foot larger trunk
3 cubic feet more interior room (mostly in the back seat)
better visibility

The Mazda does have slightly larger tires, and is rated 2 mpg higher by the epa for the manual.

But overall I think the Accord is the better car. The Mazda 6 is very good, but...."
explorerx4,Mar-15,"Regarding the Accord going 0-60 in 6.6 seconds, we've been over this before, the brakes had to be serviced every 10k and the clutch replaced at 30k.

Nice looking, and starts at $22.8 before you even start negotiating.

explorerx4: C & D certainly thrashed their Accord and wore out the clutch. But still, the Accord manual beats the Mazda6 manual but a big margin in the 0-60. Some people say that's not relevant, but I go 0-60 almost everyday on an uphill freeway ramp with a very short merge distance. 0-60 is quite relevant to me and to many people who do freeway merging."

benjaminh,Mar-15,"I'm sure your Fusion 2.0 is very fast.

Where we'll need to agree to disagree, I think, is that I still believe car magazines can have useful measurements for comparison.

I don't own a manual version of the current generation of Accord. My Accord is a 2008 EXL navi 5 MT. I think this manual was measured as having a 0-60 time of about 8 seconds. Since I shift out of 2nd well before 60 my time is probably 8.5 or more, even when I'm being aggressive.

Our 2013 Accord EXL navi has the CVT, and it seems significantly faster. I'd guess when we floor it we go 0-60 in slightly less than 8 seconds.

The V-6 Accord is seriously quick. You might be able to beat one of a drag race. I don't know. But C & D and other magazines seems to show that it's a bit faster than the 2.0 Fusion. Both are quite fast, however, and in a sense they are both winners when it comes to speed and power.

We are each fans of our respective cars, which is understandable and fine. They are both toward the top of most magazine rankings as well. We both get beat out regularly by the Mazda 6, however, and I honestly disagree about that.

Forget the speed issue for now, the standard equipment on the Accord is just more complete than what is offered on the 6 imho. But the Mazda 6 is also a very good car. I've owned 2 Mazdas in my life and I liked them both quite a bit."

I love when people buy a car because ""they sell allot of them"". There's millions of sheep trundling around in Corollas but that doesn't make them a better car. Yeah Mazda made the 6 look sporty, far more so than the stoic 1989 styled Passat, and it is a hoot to drive. But lets face it this IS a mid-sized sedan forum."

brian125,Mar-15,"stevedebi

let me rephrase . As we both know

There are no set gears in a cvt trans.Unlike a conventional automatic, . Instead, they have an infinite number of ratios..... as a belt or chain changes positions on pulleys based on engine speed.

The two variable-diameter pulleys, guide the CVT Trans effortlessly. Sounds better

Many complaints about the CVT. The one major downside is that a CVT gearbox can make the car very noisy under acceleration, the sound of the engine stays at a constant pitch, rather than rising and falling as it would with a more conventional gearbox. Another problem is CVT's are herky jerky at low speeds.

Subaru has a software update for earlier models from what I've been told that helped this problem somewhat. Another factor might be the CVT trying to learn your driving habbits. Some CVT's work better than others. Honda CVT are excellent compared to others. Honda's CRV model has a vibration problem that needs attention.

Nissan notified owners that they should have a dealer reprogram the transmission control module to eliminate belt slippage that could accelerate wear. The reprogramming was done at no charge to owners

A lot of the new Toyota Corolla's have the new belt and pulley CVT trans in them. Not sure if its made by Jatco. Have not heard many complaints with this Toyota CVT yet

Audi, Honda, Hyundai, Subaru, and Toyota all make their own CVTs. Nissan owns a controlling interest in JATCO, the firm that supplies 49 percent of the world’s gear-free transmissions to Chrysler, GM, Mi­tsu­bishi, and Suzuki. In addition, nearly half of Nissan’s current U.S. models offer a JATCO-supplied CVT.

Time will tell if these CVT trans can hold up.....especially when paired with engines with higher horsepower ."
tundradweller1_,Mar-15,"The issue with GM is when a model is flawed, like the Impala's with no rear camber adjustment or the now infamous ignition switch, they ignore it. Leaving the consumer with a sketchy vehicle.

I love all the things about the Legacy just looking at it and the overall reviews, but I am concerned that the engine was the slowest of all the Mid-Sized Family sedans for 0 - 60 in the latest CR. If memory serves me right it was close to 2 seconds slower than the Camry.We travel frequently to Pittsburgh from Columbus Ohio to visit both our families. There is some very steep terrain and I was wondering how acceleration might effect climbing that terrain with possibly 3 to 4 adults in the vehicle. I don't want the V6 (really I would prefer) because I want the better fuel mileage. I have not driven either vehicle but have an appointment to test drive the subaru next Tuesday afternoon. I have gotten quoted great prices for both vehicles. Below what CR Car Buying service included in my subsription for ConsumerReports.org says is a great price for the Subaru. $500 below what CR says is a great price and about $800 below TrueCar.com. I got a quote from a Toyota Dealership for the Camry that was $3900 off the MSRP of $30,600 which included a $500 rebate and 0% financing. Subaru is offering 1.49% financing.

Hey thanks for the reply. I actually felt the price I was quoted was much better than I expected. It was at invoice and being that there are only 3 Subaru Dealerships in the Columbus, Ohio area and two of those are owned by the same company, I was very surprised. The Legacy Limited comes very well equipped. The two I am interested in have the package with the Nav, Moonroof, push button start, BSD and auto dimming mirrors. Plus comes with Homelink and a bunch of other great features. I could get a similarly equipped Camry for about $2000 less, but the reviews from CR really woke me up to the Legacy. So the next day I stopped in a dealership and walked the lot. Just from the standpoint of appearance the Legacy was better to me. The only problem now is my Wife told me last night when we were coming home after we had been out for dinner that she didn't want me to go for the test drive. She knows that I am like a runaway train when the new car bug bites me. Said we are going to have our 3 year old Highlander paid off in May and she was hoping we might go awhile without a car payment. I am still going to slip over there because I will be working in the area that day and I can't resist. Maybe there is some kind of vaccine I can get to prevent this in the future."

No way I would trade my Highlander. That vehicle is so nice and it is continually rated the top Mid-Sized SUV. Plus the Boss, my Wife, drives it 98% of the time and she wants to keep it another 5 to 6 years. My current Fusion has been a great trouble free vehicle. It has all the options that were available with the exception of AWD back when I bought it. Great riding car with superb handling. It has the Audiophile option which is one of the best factory Audio systems I have ever heard in my 59 years. I would say there is at least a 50% chance I will drive it one more year. My problem is I get bored with cars and the fusion I have is looking a bit dated since there have been two re-designs, one minor and one major, since I bought it. Leasing has been suggested, but I drive about 15,000 miles per year in my current position in my company. The new Fusion is still and option, but I am a bit tired of Fords since we have owned a 2004 Mercury Mountaineer (best car I have ever owned) and the Fusion. Anyway, I am looking for reviews from anyone that drives or has taken a test drive for the Legacy or Camry. Preferably the 2015 versions. I haven't been reading the Forums much at all the last couple of years, but what happened to Backy? I used to see his reviews for many vehicles on the Edmunds Forums."
stickguy,Mar-15,"the Legacy is a great car. comfortable, drives nice. AWD. good MPG. If he wanders by, NYCCARGUY bought one a few months back and loves it (and it replaced a 328 BMW). Not the fastest mid size car, but more than adequate for normal use. And if you really feel a ""need for speed"" you can get the 6 cyl.

The Camry? Nice enough, but still an unengaging couch to drive.

also, you definitely can do a lease with 15K/year. Costs a little more, but if you really are trading by the 3 year mark anyway, could easily be more cost effective, since often the miles in the lease are cheaper than the hit you take for trading in a high mileage car.

Edit: Just noticed your Fusion is the V6. so yeah, you would notice the change in power in the 4 cyl Legacy (or Camry). Up to you if it matters, but you can get a 6 in either model."

Thanks for the post. I think the new Camry is pretty sharp too, but until I actually drive both I can't judge either. I will probably test drive the new Ford Fusion and possibly the Chevy Malibu as well to find out how their Turbo engines perform. That is unless the Subaru blows me away next Tuesday when I go to test drive one. I read NYCCARGUY's post and it's helpful. I really want to avoid a 6 cylinder if I can because I want the extra fuel mileage. I have never owned a vehicle in my 59 years that wasn't a 6 or 8 cylinder. I am sure it would take some getting used to and I would have to lower my expectations for performance. Like I mentioned to NYCCARGUY I am concerned the 4 bangers can easily handle the steep terrain out in eastern Ohio and western Pa. We travel there a lot because both our Mothers and a couple brothers and two sisters and many nieces and nephews live in the Pittsburgh area. When we go we sometimes take my youngest Son when he is home from College visiting us. And other times we will go get our mothers and bring them back to Columbus to spend time at our house. Of course, we have our Highlander which is more roomy and has a 272Hp V6, but gets 22mpg on the Highway on a good day. Or even if we use the car to travel to S.C. for our summer vacation. The mountains of W.VA. or Virginia would really be a tough job for an engine like that I would think. Unfortunately Columbus is very flat and there aren't alot of steep hills to test one on."

I use to rent cars to visit my Dad in Texas from Chicago and, through Costco, it wasn't much more than driving my own 6cyl vehicle down and back. Maybe cost a $75 to $100 bucks over and above what it would have cost me to drive my own and the miles didn't climb on my vehicle as a result either. It's a cheap way to find out if you can live with a 4cyl. and if it's a car of the type you are looking at anyway it's a heck of nice long test drive. Just a thought."
Michaell,Mar-15,"mtnman1 said:show previous quotesThanks for the post. I think the new Camry is pretty sharp too, but until I actually drive both I can't judge either. I will probably test drive the new Ford Fusion and possibly the Chevy Malibu as well to find out how their Turbo engines perform. That is unless the Subaru blows me away next Tuesday when I go to test drive one. I read NYCCARGUY's post and it's helpful. I really want to avoid a 6 cylinder if I can because I want the extra fuel mileage. I have never owned a vehicle in my 59 years that wasn't a 6 or 8 cylinder. I am sure it would take some getting used to and I would have to lower my expectations for performance. Like I mentioned to NYCCARGUY I am concerned the 4 bangers can easily handle the steep terrain out in eastern Ohio and western Pa. We travel there a lot because both our Mothers and a couple brothers and two sisters and many nieces and nephews live in the Pittsburgh area. When we go we sometimes take my youngest Son when he is home from College visiting us. And other times we will go get our mothers and bring them back to Columbus to spend time at our house. Of course, we have our Highlander which is more roomy and has a 272Hp V6, but gets 22mpg on the Highway on a good day. Or even if we use the car to travel to S.C. for our summer vacation. The mountains of W.VA. or Virginia would really be a tough job for an engine like that I would think. Unfortunately Columbus is very flat and there aren't alot of steep hills to test one on.A quick point of reference. We just took our 3.6R Outback on a quick road trip ... about 100 miles round trip that included a 7300' pass. Averaged 27 MPG, which is bang on the highway rating for this car. Granted, it's not the low to mid 30's MPG you'd see with the 2.5i, but still pretty decent for a car with 256 HP and 3 grown adults."
jpp75,Mar-15,"Michaell said:


That is great, I would imagine the mileage will also improve slightly after a little more break in. Over the course of a year it will cost you $300 - $400 more to drive the H6 (assuming 15,000 miles per year and gas between 2.80 and 3.80), so if you can swing the extra $30 - $40/month and prefer the power it's probably worth it. Plus for you being able to buy regular now vs. premium probably evens out any premium (no pun intended) you pay for the decreased mileage."
thebean,Mar-15,"2,000 mile report on my 2015 Accord EX:
Background - I was considering a 2014.5 Camry, a 2015 Outback, a 2015 RDX, and the 2015 Accord EX (all 4 bangers except for the RDX) to replace a 2002 Civic EX. Ultimately I went with the Accord (bought in December) after much anguish and research (most of it on Edmunds boards - thanks to all that responded to my questions back in the summer). My final two were the RDX and Accord, and the Accord features and gas mileage won me over. The Accord just passed the 2K mileage mark, and has been much as I expected it would be. Mileage has been a solid 30 mpg, with a 65/35 highway/city driving ratio. I was impressed with the LaneWatch feature, and it has not disappointed - it will be a must-have on cars for me in the future. I use the backup camera much more than I thought I would. I didn't get leather because I am not hard on interiors (my Civic cloth interior still looked great) and I am happy with that choice. The EX cloth is much more attractive than the LX cloth, I thought. The EX rode better than the LX on my test drives which is probably a function of the larger tires. No rattles in the car so far, which is impressive considering the amount of rough roads I have had to subject it to.

The 4 banger, while a little bit buzzy (not a surprise), provides all of the power I need. I am impressed with the acceleration, especially in the 30 to 60 mph range needed to merge onto the highway. I was very wary of the CVT (hate driving a manual in Dallas rush hour traffic), but so far it has been a non-issue. No vibration of any sort that I can feel, and I forget that it's not a conventional automatic trannie. The Accord does not have the smoothest ride (which, of the cars I drove, was the Camry), but it does have good handling in the curves and is pretty confidence inspiring. I suspect the handling will get better when I replace the Goodyear tires with Michelin or Pirelli tires. Recently, we had snow and ice here in Dallas, and the Accord acquitted itself superbly. No issues at all sliding or fishtailing in the snow and slush. It just pulled through with no drama. The only issue was avoiding several Mercedes drivers who were sliding all over the road after they tried to accelerate like they were on a dry road.

The one area I am a bit disappointed in are the front seats. They are not as wide as either the seats on my Civic or my wife's Lexus ES300. I have to maneuver around a bit to get the seat belt fastened, and I do not have a big butt. I am somewhat large - 6', 225 lbs, and these seats are about an inch too narrow for me. Not a huge deal, and something that I didn't even notice on my test drives. The seats are comfortable enough for me so far (except for the width), and I will get to put them to the test with two long driving vacations this year. The trunk is bigger than the Lexus trunk, and it should have no problem swallowing enough luggage for a 3 week trip.

Overall, I am very happy with my choice and if I had to do it again, I would make the same choice. I loved the Outback, but with it being a new design (I do not buy cars in their first year of production after introduction or restyle) I was very wary of quality issues. Plus, I am not convinced they have fixed their head gasket issues on their boxer 4's. The RDX would have been my first SUV, and if it had a LaneWatch feature, I might be driving it today, even with the anecdotal stories about the VCM vibrations and the lower gas mileage. I value reliability above all in a car, so that influenced my choice of the Accord over all the others. I hope to drive it for 10-15 years."

Congrats on the Accord . I shut my lane watch off the 2nd day driving it . To much noise going on in the car especially with city driving. I have to say the right side mirror camera is a homerun.... Nice feature. All cars should have it. I'm also a big guy 6'2, 245 and I found the leather seat in the Honda on long trips to be bothersome by the seat belt where it buckled. The contoured seat is the problem. The seat will get better as you break it in more. My Exl V-6 Accord came with Michelins and handled fine.

My only other complaint which is minor I don't like where Honda put its parking brake . Right in the middle of the consult. Bad job Honda. What where you thinking??? The Nissan Altima got it right.

The simple lights in the side view mirror aren't exactly simple and they are far from cheap. In certain cars, like edmunds.com's own 2015 Aluminum F150 EcoBoost, the sensors for the BLIS are located in the tail lights. It is a fantastic idea actually. The expensive part comes when you have to replace a cracked or broken tail light assembly at a cost of over $800."

akirby,Mar-15,"LW doesn't work if you don't put on your blinker or activate it manually. It requires you to look at and interpret what is on the camera taking your eyes further off the road and for longer. There is a reason having video on that screen while it's moving is illegal. You already should be checking your side mirrors so there is no added step for BLIS - if you see the light as you're checking the mirror then you know it's not safe.

LW only works on the passenger side. BLIS works on both sides. It's still up to the driver to decide if there is traffic close enough to the car - BLIS does this automatically.

The BLIS sensors may be more expensive than the camera. Not sure.

It's a neat feature but I don't think it's as useful as BLIS for the reasons mentioned above."
akirby,Mar-15,"I also don't think it's any more ""state of the art technology"" than a backup camera, much less ""class leading""."
brian125,Mar-15,"I'm sure most Honda owners with Lane watch don't drive this way. Try doing this on a highway trip. Driving my 2013 Accord from NY to Boston to visit my daughter I left the lane watch system on side mirror mostly highway with traffic so it worked well. I found periodically glancing at the mirror and seeing cars 6 maybe more behind me as I weaved in and out from the left to the middle lane..... very satisfying . A birds eye view with full coverage. Honda's Lane watch can view up to 75 feet behind your right side. I find the side Camera leaves you more confident changing lanes than looking for a tiny light on your mirror. By glancing in the mirror I now see 75 feet behind me at all times . Regardless you still have to turn your head and look but I feel more confident on that left side.

Ford's bliss system needs a voice alert or chime inside the vehicle to go along with its light . That would makes this system so much better.

New vehicle technology with Satellite guided laser Cross Traffic alert systems, Braking , features is now putting these Camera's front , back, and side of vehicles. Subaru has eyesight and Cross traffic options on there vehicles this year.

I'd like to see all vehicles with Honda's lane watch systems on both sides with not only camera's watching your sides and back but also light indicators on side mirrors with voice alerts and vibrating seat alert.

Just a matter of time before all vehicles have these options.

mtnman1,Mar-15,"Had an opportunity to drive both the Legacy and Camry in the last few days. Both were short trips at this point. Having never driven a vehicle with a CVT I was impressed how well it worked in the Legacy Limited 2.5 with a slight feeling as if it was actually shifting gears. Lowering my expectations on engine power since my Fusion has a 6 cylinder I felt acceleration was reasonably strong onto to the expressway.Got up to 70 miles per hour fairly quickly. The ride was very smooth and the interior very quiet. Barely noticed the bumps in the road. It was raining and the roads were wet. Could hardly hear any tire noise in the cabin. The leather used on the seats felt very substantial and it was easy to find a comfortable driving position. With my long legs I often have a difficult time having the seat far enough back and being able to pull the steering wheel out far enough to allow my elbows to rest comfortably on the door and center console. Legacy's steering wheel came out quite a bit. Liked the blue lit background on the speedometer. Very easy to see.

The next day I drove a Camry XSE. It was a dry day and we immediately pulled onto a 4 lane highway with a speed limit of 55. Accelerated very well and the ride was smooth. It seemed the Tire noise radiated more into the cabin, but I am not sure if it was the road surface that caused that. In the Legacy I was driving on strictly blacktop over concrete surfaces versus the Camry which seemed to be strictly concrete. I will have to try to take both on different routes and request that I go on my own without the salesmen. As in my Highlander, I couldn't get the steering wheel to come out as far as I would like to be 100% comfortable. Had to move the seat in a little closer than what is optimum for my driving comfort. It's something I can deal with but would prefer not to. The XSE has leather trim with suede inserts in the seats which is very nice. I liked the center stack better on the Camry than that of the Legacy. Nice big knobs while the Legacy had two tiny knobs for the radio. Legacy had a nicer sounding stereo system which is important since I spend a lot of time driving every day for work. Kind of had a lot of hard plastic surfaces but looked good.

I will have to go back and drive both for a longer period of time and on different road surfaces. I have to give the edge to the Legacy at this point. I have ruled out the Fusion, Malibu, and I just don't care for Hondas. With the Marysville plant in Central Ohio about every other car is a Honda in about 3 different colors. Too much. I won't try the Mazda6 due to the poor review by CR on the fairly loud interior noise. Would have most likely driven it but I have to have a quiet interior when I am driving. Might consider testing the Sonata. Or I might just keep my Fusion one more year since it has just about all the important attributes I like in a car. Great handling, smooth ride, fairly quiet interior, and the best Factory sound system I have ever heard in a mid sized family sedan."
stickguy,Mar-15,"having driven the both, cost independent, I greatly preferred the Legacy. But, from what you are looking for, I would recommend you take a look at the Sonata too (speaking from experience since I own one!)"

explorerx4,Mar-15,"mtnman1,
Since you already have a Fusion, you should look at another one. Your car has the PI Duratec V6, which has plenty of power. It's much better than the previous version of the same engine I had in a 2007 Fusion.
I have a 2013 Fusion Titanium with a 2.0 Ecoboost 4cylinder. The power is similar, and gets much better mileage than the V6.
The Sony stereo is pretty good. You should at least try one."

nyccarguy,Mar-15,"@mtnman1
I'm glad you liked the Legacy. I feel the power is definitely adequate. But if there is any doubt, the give the 6 cyl a test drive. Good luck. At the end of this month, I'll be at 6 months of ownership and cross over the 10,000 mile mark;)"

That will be a very sad day for people who get pleasure from driving. When that day comes what point will there be to have different cars. Might as well have a Box like a transit bus but smaller. Would just have different levels of luxury in your Box. You could just tell your friends that you just ordered a new 2035 Box in the future. They would ask you what does it look like and you could just reply it looks like a box. Could just have a bed in it so you could go and take a nap while the car drives and a TV so you can catch up on shows or watch movies. Hopefully that will be at least 25 years from now and I will be 84. Driving might not matter to me by then."
explorerx4,Mar-15,"My left front tire/fender were hit today while my Fusion was parked.
It was about 375 miles back home, so on a stretch on nice I-80 in PA, I let go of the wheel for about 1/2 a mile with the cruise set to 72.
The car tracked perfectly straight, so I guess there is no alignment issue.
PA has put a lot of work into the Interstates from the New York border, headed toward Ohio."
mtnman1,Mar-15,"Today I test drove the Subaru Legacy Limited again then walk across the lot and Drove a 2015 Mazda6 Grand Touring. Both dealerships are owned by the same company and I was able to work with the same salesman. Again I was totally impressed with the Legacy. Found out a neat little plus for it was it had memory driver seat! I had that on my 2004 Mercury Mountaineer and loved it. It's frustrating that on our $40K Highlander Limited it was not available. Anyway, the Mazda6 is a sweet looking car. Had good power and was able to take it hard through an S Curve and it handled like my Fusion. I like the fuel mileage it could get and also the fact that CR rated as excellent in reliability. I loved the LED running lights. What I didn't like was I had a difficult time finding a comfortable driving position, the noise level right after coming out of the Legacy, and the seats were rather short in my thighs. My Fusion comes within a couple of inches of my knees but the Mazda seemed to come about 4 inches from the bend in my leg. While the noise was not terrible the Legacy seemed so much more luxurious and cabin noise was much less though the engine was a little more noisy.The Legacy had a much more comfortable ride. There were 2016 Mazda's on the lot and I sat in one. I liked the dash better than the 2015. Both cars look good, but at this point I have to give the edge to the Legacy. When I got back in my Fusion I realized that I still really love the car so I am not sure if I would regret giving it up. It hits all the important marks for me. Rides well, reasonably quiet cabin, good power especially as compared to the others, good looking, great sound system, very comfortable seats, and most of all it's paid for. The only negative is I only get about 21 mpg overall. That is the very great thing about the Mazda is the fuel mileage."
nyccarguy,Mar-15,"@mtnman1 - I would NEVER buy a car based on its fuel economy alone (FE is actually far down on my list and I driver 20K miles per year). It is just a recipe for disaster.

It seems that you really dig the Legacy. That's great. You are taking your time and going on multiple test drives to make sure you do really love it before you part ways with your Fusion which you like. Take a test drive in a 6 cylinder Legacy 3.6R Limited and tell us what you think. The H6 is smoother and quieter than the H4 you test drove. With the CVT, your mileage will not suffer as much as you think. Either way, you are going to have to pump the same 18.5 gallons of gas in it every time."
mtnman1,Mar-15,"nyccarguy said:

You're right that Fuel Economy should never be at the top of your list for buying a car. I have never based my decision solely on that otherwise I would be looking at a Prius. I have to own a car that is a pleasure to drive and I wouldn't be caught dead in a Prius. Butt ugly. Regardless because of my job and having to drive more I still feel I am going to go with the 4 banger. My Company keeps cutting back on our allowance and cents per mile. The Mazda6 had many great features besides great fuel economy. It is a beautiful car and I'm still not discounting it as a possibility. I will probably drive it again as it is the top rated Mid Sized for reliability by CR. I think the controls on the steering wheel are easier to use along with the large knob down by the center consol to switch to radio, Navigation, etc. without actually taking your eyes off the road. I found myself fumbling around the Legacy while driving trying to even find the fuel gauge. The Mazda also had LED running lights which were very sharp plus the duel exhaust was a nice touch though it means nothing. I'm sure like with any new car there is a learning curve to get used to all the controls. If I had to choose this very moment it would be the Legacy. Either way I think I would be happy with either one.

The Auto Show starts this weekend in Columbus and my Subaru/Mazda Salesman has given me two passes for admission and also Vip Passes to the Dealership's booth.

suydam,Mar-15,I was going to suggest Accord also. We've taken ours on several long trips and it is comfortable and gets great mileage.
explorerx4,Mar-15,"Since you like your Fusion, you should at a new one. The 2.0 has the same horsepower as your car, but lots more torque. I drove 'up' to my sister's in PA on Sunday. 370 miles in 6 hours including a couple of stops, but not for fuel, 27 mpg. On the way back down, same 6 hours to get back, average just under 31. In PA, I put the cruise on 72 and it never downshifted once, no matter how big the hill.
You could also look at a hybrid model if you are leaning more towards fuel mileage."
suydam,Mar-15,You will get 36-40 highway (depending on season) with the Accord and 27-28 city. So quite a bit better. But if mileage isn't as much of a priority another Fusion would make sense since you like the one you have. Or try Fusion hybrid.
mtnman1,Mar-15,"I appreciate everyone's input. I don't care for the Accord appearance wise. Just a personal preference. Plus with the Marysville plant right here in central Ohio there are so many Honda's around that I can't even look at them. Kind of getting tired of the latest Fusion design but I won't rule out test driving one. Look at the mileage results in the latest CR and the fusion does very poorly. I would try the Hybrid but I want the 19"" H spoke wheels if I get one and they aren't offered for the Hybrid. Don't want to spend the money on a Titanium Hybrid. I'm looking to get my max down to around $28,000 before Tax, Title, and closing costs. I have them down to invoice for the Legacy so far. Just spent $40,000 for a Highlander 3 years ago and I am nearing retirement. Want to be smart while at the same time not sacrificing some Luxury. The Legacy was the top rated Mid Sized Sedan in CR. It had a Luxury Car ride according to the magazine. I can say without a doubt that they were right. Plus I really thought driving position was easily found when I have driven it and I think it and the Mazda 6 are the best looking of all of them. I am going to the International Auto Show which opens in Columbus, Ohio this weekend so I can look at them all in one place.."
benjaminh,Mar-15,"mtnman1: Here's a thought I don't think you'll go for, but please hear me out. What about considering the car I'm thinking of for my next ride: the Acura TLX. I admit that it's a bit above your price target, but not by as much as you might think. The ""base"" model starts at $32k, but I think that with some good negotiation you might be able to get that down to c. $29.5. The base model is pretty lavishly equipped with heated power memory seats, smart entry/pushbutton start, moonroof, premium stereo with satellite radio, LED headlights, universal garage door opener, electronic parking brake, Integrated Dynamic System (Sport +, Econ, etc. modes), 8 speed dual-clutch transmission with exclusive torque converter and paddle shifters, fancy alloy wheels, luxe interior, etc. Here's the only video test online of this base TLX model, but check out this interior and drive compared to a Subaru:



I think the guy testing this is wrong about a couple of minor things. The interior trim is ""fake"" wood and aluminum, although it looks pretty good. And the standard seats, as with a base BMW, are ""pleather"" not leather.

But anyway, if you own the car for six years, that would be only about $300 to $400 more a year than some regular midsize cars with lots of options. About a dollar a day to go from a regular ride to this seems worth it to me. The combined EPA mpg rating on the TLX is 28, compared to 30 for the Subaru. Heading for retirement I think you might appreciate the luxury of the TLX. The Subaru is no doubt a good car, but based on the Subarus my parents and sister have owned they are not particularly ""special."" For Subaru I think of their tagline from long ago: ""Inexpensive. And built to stay that way.""

The standard warranty of an Acura is also longer: 4 years/50 k miles bumper to bumper, plus 6 years/70k miles for the engine and transmission. And I think the TLX definitely sets you apart a bit more than a Subaru or other mainstream midsize car."

I'm sure the Subaru is fine. Great mpg plus AWD. It's an impressive combo for sure.++ Went to the website and looked at the pix, and it seemed like the higher end models of the Legacy look quite nice now compared to most Surbarus of even 5 or so years ago:

If I can decide before they quit getting the 2015's in. 2016 models are due out in June the salesman said. Won't be any real deals on them at first. I never cared for Subaru before until I went and saw it up close and drove it. I had to take my Fusion in for Maintenance today and saw the Salesman that sold me the car. While there he mentioned that they have $3000 in rebates as well as 0% financing in addition to the deal he would give me for a new Fusion. I might give them a close look since there many to choose from. The thing I am finding with Mazda 6 and the Legacy is that all the dealerships have maybe 12 on the lot at most. One of the two Silver Subaru's sold today at the Dealership I have been working with according to the salesman. There is one remaining. I can only find one other in the State in that color and trim.. If you look online at what a ford dealer has for Fusions in inventory they will list 70 cars and Honda will have just as many Accords to choose from. Toyota dealerships show over 30 Camrys in stock.

Was going to the Auto Show tomorrow, but we have the NCAA Basketball Tournament going on this weekend and the Arena is two blocks from the Convention Center where the Auto Show is going on at the same time. They were reporting on our local news at 6 tonight that parking was going to be very difficult to find. I think we will skip it. Maybe instead I will take my wife over to the Subaru/Mazda dealership then drive back towards home to the Ford dealership."

benjaminh,Mar-15,Are there a lot of Fusions on the lots that are built in the US now? Isn't that factory now up to full speed? A Fusion 2.0 with a $3000 incentive sounds like a great deal.

How do I get on there payroll? I would be a superstar

My golf buddy leased the 2015 Chrysler 200. Great lease price...... hates the vehicle.

Chrysler 200 has good gas mileage and looks good. There are many negatives on this vehicle. Bad brakes , Terrible 9sp trans, very low ground clearance for a family sedan, Ride is rough, Handling is clumsy, Cramped cock pit, headroom is terrible, egress is terrible. Taller than 6' you hit your head getting out of vehicle. His 200 has been back to dealer 4 times with problems.

How is the 200 not last in these ratings.

Cars 8, 9, and 10 are all better choices .

Id like to take the best from each vehicle and make 1 great midsizer. The 2016 kia optima will be out soon and should be on par with the new redesign 2015 Sonata. I'm sure it will be a good bang for the buck like its brother.

Check out Ricart Ford's website in Columbus. Titaniums discounted by more than $6000. I can get a Hybrid SE from the dealership I bought my Current Fusion from that lists for 33,585 for 28,285 with Rebates and discount. I saw the car yesterday and spoke to the Salesman I bought from about it. Pretty loaded up with Luxury Package, Moonroof, My ford touch w/Navigation, etc. Ruby Red w/Black Leather. Sweet looking. I may go back and drive it if it hasn't sold already.

We decided to go to the Auto Show today. My wife was wowed with the 2016 Mazda6 Grand Touring in Soul Red w/Black Leather. I was too. The Legacy was in the next display area. Looked good but kind of bland when compared to the 6. Still like it though. Just aggravating that there are so few available."

backy,Mar-15,"I got my first ride in a 2015 Sonata yesterday. My son decided to get rid of his 2004 Elantra GT before anything major breaks on it and before the expensive 120k service, and while it's still worth something, so I went with him as he ventured into the new car world for the first time. He wanted a sign & drive lease with low payments, and our local Hyundai dealers are offering great deals on those post-auto show so we went to the dealer with the lowest advertised lease deal and biggest inventory first. First he drove an Elantra SE, but when he found out the Sonata SE would be only ~$30 more a month he decided to take it for a spin. I rode shotgun. I thought the car was very smooth and quiet, even over some bad roads, and the passenger seat was very comfortable for me--Hyundai added a height adjuster for 2015. My son liked how it drove, and said it handled well for its size, but after talking with the sales manager (who advised him to not get more car than he needs--same advice I gave him) and thinking it over, he went with the Elantra. He got a good deal on that I think, after all rebates including College Grad and my $250 VIP new car bonus, just $174/month sign & drive for 36 months (only 35 payments), 12k/year. And that was with Tier 4 credit (classic case of a young person with almost no credit history). As we went over all the features of this $20,300 car (backup camera, Bluetooth, color touch screen, 16"" alloys, fog lamps etc.) with the sales rep, I remarked, ""You have a nicer car than your dad!"" Made me think back to the first car I bought: a new 1976 Corolla 2-door sedan with AM radio and 3-speed AT, and 2-55 AC. That car cost only $3600, but it would equate to nearly $15k today, so in hindsight my son's Elantra isn't all that more expensive than my first car in 1976. But a lot nicer!"
stickguy,Mar-15,"sounds like a good deal. at least it is fixed cost you can budget, unlike an old car that you never know when it is going to do something bad to you! Even buying something you can easily spend more than 6K (total of payments) over 3 years factoring in repairs (including tires and brakes) and depreciation, plus you are still dealing with an old car.

that's why when my recent college grad son got FT work, he leased a car to replace the 175K mile Acura. Needed reliable, and he did not have much cash to put down at the time. so it was the way to get manageable payments while he saved up some money and payed down his student loans.

next car, he will likely buy."
nyccarguy,Mar-15,"backy said:

Congrats! Sounds like a great deal on a very well equipped car. I'm a big proponent of leasing inexpensive, reliable cars for young people. Could he have pushed the 2004 Elantra for another 2 - 3 years? Sure, but now his costs are completely fixed. $174 per month for the next 3 years is fantastic for someone just starting out.

Good job convincing him to not get more car than he needs. The only problem with leasing is that it is very easy to get on that ""well, it is only $x more per month"" slippery slope. That's how my wife ended up with her 2007 BMW X3.

We walked into a Honda dealer (literally walked as it was 1/4 mile down the street from our apartment). It was the summer of '07 and I thought we could strike a deal on a V6 Accord that was due to be replaced. I drove an Accord and a CRV. Anyway, my wife didn't like the Accord (too many she said) and I didn't like the CRV (felt like I was sitting on a Toilet and it ad ZERO pickup). I tried to get a number out of the salesman who I guess was afraid I'd shop his price, so he told me CRVs are selling like hot cakes. Selling price is MSRP, leasing ""in the 4s."" I pushed further. What does $4s mean? Are we talking $405 or $489? Anyway, we left.

I looked into the Passat wagon. Very nice car. Lots of features. Got an honest to goodness email quote from the dealer breaking down everything (cap cost, residual, $0 down, 15K per year with tax included). But it was the last day of the month and they needed me to come down today not to buy, but to get the credit app in so thy could hold the price. I didn't check my email until late that night & missed my chance. Went to the dealer Monday & VW credit is pushing financing rather than leasing that month. $398 per month became $445.


I got a hold of a BMW dealer tat had an X3 with not too many options. $471.67. Done;)"

ab348,Mar-15,I owned a 2011 Regal Turbo and drove a 2015 like the one pictured before deciding on my ATS. The Regal is a very nice car that flies under the radar. Main disadvantage is its weight and a tight back seat. The weight does give it a very solid feel and it is absolutely glued to the road - best highway cruiser I ever experienced. With the upgraded engine that began in 2014 it is quite zippy too. I would recommend one.

This is a good example where lease deals aren't equal. I've seen Honda's LX lease at around $200/month, sometimes a little more, advertised for years in my area. But it's always with a big chunk of money up front. For the deal you mentioned, it would be close to $3000 up front on the Accord LX with the down payment ($1800), first payment, and TT&L (in Minnesota, you pay sales tax on all lease payments including down payment up front). But yesterday at a local Hyundai dealer, they were offering Sonata SEs for $209/month ""sign & drive"" for 36 months, before any special discounts like College Grad or Military or Loyalty (there is a $1000 auto show rebate right now). That's a big difference in cost. Even though the Accord LX is a great car, I don't think it's $3000 better than the Sonata SE."
benjaminh,Mar-15,"Well, the lease offer on the Accord is before negotiation. I've never done a lease, but I think with negotiation the price difference might be less than you suggest—but I'm not sure. Hyundai is really blowing them out the door with low offers.

On a slightly different topic, Edmunds has a ""true cost to own"" feature. And the link Honda has to this feature seems to show that when you count projected maintenance, fuel economy, depreciation, etc., etc., that the Accord is overall likely to cost a little less than the Sonata over 5 years:

http://automobiles.honda.com/shop/cost-to-own/?ModelName=cr-v

But the cost difference looks to be only c. $600, and so if the Sonata has a greater rebate than the Accord I assume that would be erased and more....

Edmunds 5-Year Cost to Own®[2]
Honda Accord
LX 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl CVT)
$39,672
Ford Fusion
S 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl 6A)

Nissan Altima
2.5 S 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl CVT)

The Sonata and the Accord are both very good cars. I personally prefer the Accord because it has best in class visibility as well as a few other things, but no doubt the Sonata beats the Accord out on a few things, including price."
benjaminh,Mar-15,"2015 Sonata compared with 2015 Accord

Both of these are very good cars. Each one wins on different measurements.

MSRP of base model with auto before destination
Sonata: $21,150
Accord: $22,905

That's a difference of 1755, but the Sonata doesn't have a standard back up camera and doesn't even have any padding on the doors for this price. The Accord has both of these things. The Sonata does have an $1100 pkg that has the camera, the door padding, as well as a power seat, which then takes it past the base Accord but still gives it a lower msrp by several hundred dollars. Anyway, on msrp for comparable models the Sonata is several hundred dollars less, and when rebates are counted that might turn into $1000-$2000 dollars less. So the advantage on purchase price goes to the Sonata.

EPA MPG combined. Slight edge to the Accord for fuel economy.
Accord: 31
Sonata: 29

Warranty bumper to bumper & engine/transmission. Hyundai of course is the winner here.
Sonata: 5 year 60k mi & 10/100k
Accord: 3 year 36k mi & 5/60k

horsepower is a tie....
Accord: 185hp
Sonata: 185 hp

Both are rated Top Safety Picks by IIHS, which is another tie.

For rear visibility the Accord is the clear winner

EPA passenger volume gives a slight edge to the Sonata
Sonata: 106
Accord: 103

I personally like the styling of the Accord better, but that's obviously a matter of taste.

In terms of reliability and durability, I'd say they are probably about the same. And they are both made in the USA at top factories.

In terms of fun-to-drive, I'd give the edge to the Accord, which has been named by Car and Driver a 10 best for decades in part based on that.

In terms of a quiet and cushy ride, the award for that goes to the Sonata.

For acceleration 0-60, I think the Accord is slightly faster.

The Accord will likely do a bit better on resale value.

Again, both of these cars are great choices. It's really a matter of taste."
benjaminh,Mar-15,"But even if the Sonata has a price advantage, there are definitely very good deals available on the Accord. ""ocbuyer"" in So Cal reports he just got a 2015 Accord EX auto with a list of $26,650 for $22,111, or over $4500 off of list."
stickguy,Mar-15,"you can get deals on either one of them. really depends on the particular dealer and market. certainly both nice cars, with different strengths and weaknesses. so as always, try them, and get what you like best. really hard to go wrong.

one thing though on the Sonata that was mentioned earlier. It has a much more comfortable (to me) passenger seat, with height adjustment. some of these cars, I could not sit over on the passenger side, because the seat is way too low and flat."
backy,Mar-15,"benjaminh said:

The $209 sign & drive offer on the Sonata was without negotiation. The dealer that offered it has a no-haggle price policy.

No doubt you might be able to get a better deal than the advertised lease deal on the Accord. But it's a difference of about $80 a month. Based on what I've seen here re discounts being offered to buy an Accord, that might be the best route to take on those vs. a lease. Of course, there's big discounts when buying a Sonata too. Not to mention on others in the class such as the Fusion, Camry, Altima, Optima, and 200.

Five-year cost of ownership numbers are important if you're going to own a car for five years. If you plan on leasing for 3 years, then getting another car, I think the cost equation will be overwhelmingly in favor of the Sonata. In fact, the same dealer who had the SE for $209/month was offering Sonata Sports for $229/month. But my choice if I were to get a Sonata would be the Eco, which offers an average EPA FE of 32 mpg."

To be honest, Accord was my favorite car previously in mid-size sedan level. I like the style, the tight sporty steering wheel etc. Well, i changed my mind after 2015 sonata came out. It improved a lot from its previous generation. 2011 hyundai got the new ex-Audi designer and redesigned all there cars. I think the real success that time was Kia Optima except its steering wheel alignment problem. 2011 - 2014 hyundai sonata, em, it was different from 2010 model, but wasn't mind breaking. But 2015 sonata is a big deal.

I got the 2015 sonata with tech package 10 days ago and really like it so far. You can feel how much effort they put in the detail of the car.

One comment i would like to share is people keep talking about the steering wheel of sonata. Yes, many people like Accord's steering wheel tuning, but if you turn on the sport mode of 2015 sonata which is available in base model and i really enjoyed, you would get a very tight steering wheel tuning and it was more than enough for me.

If talking about package, design, interior etc, I don't think Accord or any of the car in this level can beat Sonata. But I believe Accord is more about mechanical reliability now. It has a long history and good record and reputation. Hyundai is still new to the US market and need time to prove its reliability. I like the way Hyundai upgrading its car every year, you would drive a car that no one has ever seen. On the other hand, 2015 accord doesn't look much different from five years ago but it may also means it's a very reliable model."

benjaminh,Mar-15,"Regarding the one or two at this price thing, I have to say that my family has benefited a lot from these specials over the years. In 1979, my parents bought a new Datsun/Nissan 210 for $3710 in the LA area. One only, but we got there when they opened and got it. In 1986 we got a brand-new Mazda B2000 LX longbed for $5995, which was about $1500 off of list iirc. In 1989 we got a loaded Toyota Tercel Wagon for, iirc, $7995. More recently, In 2002, I bought a brand new 2002 Accord LX for c. $15,700, which was almost c. $3.5 k off of list at the time. After that, Honda told their dealers to stop advertising on price, but some dealers will still give killer price quotes via email, such as Crest Honda in Nashville, which has a ""TruePrice"" policy. They show list price on their website, but ask for a price quote and they'll send you one that's right away $3000+ off of list on most Accords, and during the summer sales you can sometimes get close to $4k off of list.

My 13 EX has the Good Year Assurance Fuel Max tires. At first I was somewhat disappointed because I prefer Michelins based on past experience. After 36000 miles I have no complaints. They seem quiet enough, and have not
gotten any noisier that I am aware of over time. They are vibration free and have been good in heavy rain. Still have 7/32 tread, wearing evenly and track straight. At replacement time I am seriously considering staying with them. At $50 tire less than the Michelin, not sure if I am really compromising."

How interesting that you would find as noisy. For me it's the quiet Honda! I wonder what tires were on it. Really it shows that you can't take anyone's word when it comes to these things. You have to drive them to see what's right for you. Is the Altima on your list? So are you now leaning Legacy and maybe Fusion again?
I am leaning Legacy. Would really consider a 2016 mazda6 which are just hitting the dealerships, but there won't be many deals on them. The interior had some nice changes over the 2015 that I would want. At the Auto Show last saturday in Columbus they had a Soul Red Grand Touring that had people lined up to get inside it. It was absolutely gorgeous. When I took a test drive a couple weeks ago in a 2015 it handled very well and had a lot of power in that 4 cylinder. Had a bit of road noise but not overwhelming. Rode very smooth. CR rates this car with excellent Reliability and excellent owner satisfaction. The Altima is out due to the poor reliability ratings plus I am not a huge fan of the look. Not bad but I don't want to own it. I would say the Legacy is my number 1. I have an appointment friday afternoon to test drive the Fusion SE Hybrid and either an SE with the 2 liter turbo or a Titanium. The dealership I bought my 2009 has two SE Hybrids on the lot. Both have the Luxury package, Moonroof, Rear Sensors in addition to the rear Camera, Heated Steering wheel, and some other options I can't remember. One of them has the Navigation and the other doesn't. I don't need Navigation which to me is a waste but in so many cars you have to get the Navigation to get the other things you want. That was a good thing about the Accord as well. You could get the Navigation as a stand alone option. I would really like to get the Hybrid but I hate the god awful wheels they put on them. I really would like the H Spoke wheels but they don't come with them."

I test drove one several weeks ago. Not sure what you are talking about as far a negative reviews. Overall I think they are still one of the better Mid-Sized Sedans. Also have very good resale value. One of the most popular cars in the world. I think the new XSE is very good looking. It drove quite well and very smooth. About the second less noisy cabin behind the Legacy. Haven't driven a new Fusion yet so not sure how that will be. Good pick up from the 4 Cylinder. Interior was very nice. Center stack layout was very easy to work with. Good sized Dials and would be very easy to learn how to navigate around the screen. Nice leather seats and overall a good solid car. It's not a high performance sports car but a good reliable family sedan. It is still highly rated by CR. I just couldn't buy one because we already own a Highlander and the interiors are very similar. I don't want to feel like I am driving two identical vehicles. I like to change up my cars and I am not brand loyal. I will drive whatever I like and use ratings as a guide."

Hey nyccarguy. Appreciate your input as I have really appreciated everyone's input on this subject. It really does help in the car buying decision. I am a bit concerned with the average mpg you have had thus far in the 2.5. It is rated 25 city and 36 Highway. Was hoping for at least 28 mpg overall. Maybe it will get better with time. I really do have to see about the Fusion Hybrid. The EPA rates it 44/41 but CR rates it 39 mpg overall which would be fantastic to me since my current V6 gets about 21 overall. Would be a huge savings especially if fuel prices rise in the next few years."

Thanks for the comment. I wouldn't say Camry is not a good car. It is still a top reliable family sedan. But I just don't feel it is right with Toyota. And on the other hand, i am very curious about why they are doing this. When all other competitors (Honda, Ford, Subaru, Hyundai, Nissan ,Kia) are trying so hard to redesign their exterior, interior, increasing driving experience, making it high-tech etc, Toyota is just sitting there and watching. Previously, I guess MPG was Toyota's important selling point comparing with its US competitors. Now everyone got 30+ MPG on highway and 25+ MPG in the city.

I can't agree more with the last sentence in the following review by Cars.com
http://www.cars.com/toyota/camry/2015/expert-reviews
""Camry sales aren't likely to falter with this latest update to the brand's icon, but Toyota has done nothing to attract new buyers to the model. The new Camry is perfectly suited to keeping current owners happy for another generation when they trade in their old model, but given how good and advanced the competition has become, ""I already own one and want another"" may be the only reason left to buy the Camry over its competitors.""


Yes, Toyota's reliability is not questionable. They are good at making a car as a machine. But fall way behind in modern design. One more example is I was shocked when Toyota released their new concept in hydrogen electric car named Fuel Cell Car which was a weird Corolla looking shell with hydrogen engine. I would rather buy an electric Smart than that ugly hydrogen corolla."
explorerx4,Mar-15,"@mtnman1,
NAV is a standalone option on the Fusion. The 19 inch wheels are an $800 or $900 upgrade over the 18 inch wheels, but they list for $800 each to replace(don't curb one).
If the car has MyFord Touch, you get the same center screen NAV or not.
It basically has 4 functions, accessed by touching each corner of the screen.
The NAV tab is a compass if you don't have the NAV option.
Titanium should have paddle shifters for the transmission."

The more I see it on the road the more I like the looks. More chiseled and gives an overall impression of quality assembly. However, the only way for me to tell it is a Sonata at more than 300 feet away is the LED DRL's. Other than. That it is very similar to the Legacy in the front end, and now just looks like another anonymous car.

2012 Kia Opt EX 40k report since purchased new December 23rd 2011:

From my short love affair with the new Ecoboost Mustang, to other mid size sedans, I still think my 2012 EX in Spicy Red is one of the best looking cars on the road. I took my kids to test the Mustang with me, and there was just no back seat space for human legs. Only my 10 year olden ""fit"" AMD the seat does not go back far enough for me to be comfortable. I was surprised at how fast I appreciated my Optima again as I drove off the lot.

Maintenance report after very cold, snowy winter for this area: I replaced my Bosch ""blade"" wipers with rain-X ""hybrid"" wipers. The Bosch were only 8 months old; but a streak developed on the drivers side right in my primary field of view....aggravating. I use Rain X so this switch was a no-brained and I am totally blown away at how good they work... and look.

Brakes at 39,500 and 3.4 years old:

Dealer wanted $120 + new fluid + disposal for a total of $140 for a brake fluid flush (it was black for many miles) I had it done at Merchants for $69.99. I did have the actual brake job done at the dealer and they threw in a front end alignment check because of all the potholes. I thought that was nice, and after hitting at least 10 ""oh s***"" depth sized ones (we are not used to them here) I am happy to say that my car was spot on aligned and no bent rims or blow outs occurred. Durable.

Paint: Lots of scratches from gratuitous salt and an angry ""it's not you-it's me"" breakup caused my car trunk to be bladed. I compounded, polished, and waxed it. You can barely see it now. She was cray-cray."

I was aware of the Nav being stand alone and also that I could get the Titanium with the wheels I want. You can't get the nicer wheels on the Hybrid SE. I went to the dealership that I have been doing business with the last 6 plus years to drive a loaded Hybrid SE this afternoon. Salesman had it sitting out front and as soon as I pulled in my parking spot and got out he hit the start button on the remote. Came out and went over a few details. I drove it about 30 miles about 95% interstate. Got up to 37 mpg on the car's computer which I am sure would improve over time due to the car having 38 miles on it when I got in it. Road noise was slightly intrusive. Kind of had trouble getting a comfortable position in the seat. I would have to get used to the buzzing sound coming from probably the fact that it was a Hybrid. It had pretty good accelaration for what it is. When I finished driving I really liked the fact that it was a Hybrid and extremely good looking. The one I was driving had an exterior color called Guard which was a beautiful Dark Green and the interior was the Pukey looking cream. I could not drive around in that interior. What killed it for me was when I opened the trunk to see how much space I would lose with the battery. Way too small for all the samples I have to carry around for my job. Disappointing because I think with the black leather interior I would have given it serious consideration. I also liked the advertised price of $5600 off which I would work to get reduced more. I am going to drive a Titanium sometime next week. At least with that they have a grey interior available. I have to say though IMO I really do not think any of the cars I have driven are as nice overall as the Legacy. I still want to have an open mind about the Fusion Titanium or an SE with the 2 liter Turbo."

The new sonata and Legacy's front end was almost identical except the sonata's front is just a little higher.Thanks for the pictures illustrating my point. It is like Subaru bought a Sonata, scanned it into the design computer, and just changed it enough to not get sued. Take a hard lol at the headlights. Maybe they are the same part number???However, the Subie has AWD ad the Sonata does not. Having owned AWD cars and SUV's with proper 4x4 systems and my impression is that they are not necessary here in Virginia. With both cars being 4"" off the ground, it makes no difference in 8"" of snow.Both are great cars, but the AWD system in the Subie is going to cost more in maintenance (like having to buy all 4 tires at once) has an extra computer to run the AWD hardware, and then there is the actual mechanical system with 4 half-shafts and a sophisticated Haldex AWD diff lock.If I lived just 60 to 100 miles North of here it would be a different story, but where I live is blocked by the Appalachian mountains, so most snow events miss us and hit Pittsburg and cities near it."

It has the Luxury Package, Moonroof, Heated Steering Wheel, Push Button Start and Remote start, MyFord Touch and many more options. It does not have the Nav, but I have to pay extra for the Color Choice. The Trunk space bothers me and the Black Leather with a dark exterior bakes me in the summer in my current Fusion, but I think I can deal with trunk by being creative about packing it. I want that mpg increase in a great looking car. Have an appointment at 1:30 today to go back to Subaru and drive the Legacy again. Want to take it out for a longer drive. The talk about the AWD system in this thread does not deter me. They have one of the best systems in the car industry. Don't know if I will make a decision even after driving it again for the fourth time. Never had a more difficult time making a decision about a car purchase plus what to do with my current vehicle. Do I trade it and get roughly $8K or do I give it to my Son who is Graduating with a Degree in Chemistry on May 10. I could have a good down payment and just write a check for $12K for a total down payment of $20K. Or I could give it to him, lose the 8K and the reduction in the Sales Tax.

mtnman1,Mar-15,"Went back today to my Ford Dealership and drove another Fusion Hybrid SE which did not have navigation (Didn't need). I took a long drive about 35 miles and about 50/50 City and Highway. Got up to 45 mpg and overall ran 41 mpg according to the Car's Computer. Car had 35 miles on it when I started. Loved it. Plenty of power and very comfortable. When I got back to the dealership I got out, positioned the front seats to see how the back seats were. Seemed to have more legroom than the Legacy. Checked the trunk again and decided I would make it work for my job for the hopefully potential large savings in gas. It is a Ruby Red exterior with Black Leather Interior. Options are Equipment Group 502A which include Heated Leather seats and many other things, Moonroof w/iniversal Garage Door Opener, SE Hybrid Tech/My Ford Touch Pkg, Reverse Sensing System, Heated Steering Wheel, All Weather Floor Mats, and Intelligent Access w/Push Button Start. The above include Remote Start, Memory driver seat and many more goodies. Went in and asked the Salesman if we could sit down in his office to go over the numbers. MSRP was $32,795 and selling price was $28,205 with discount and rebates. He wouldn't budge on the price which was already over $400 less than the True Price Retail and even lower than Consumer Report's Car Buying deal. He agreed to instead change my trade in appraisal from $7700 to $8700 which will also save me a total of $652 in Sales Tax. Gave him $1000 to hold it until Tuesday so my Wife and I can both come over for the financing. I am writing a check for $12000 along with the trade making the OTD total $29,907. Getting $9207 financed for 3 years which I may just pay at signing as well. Won't have to worry about the 19"" wheels.

I was really blown away by what the Salesman showed me when going over things about the car. With my remote start I am able to open all the windows and the Moonroof by hitting the Unlock botton twice and holding it down which will be great on a hot summer day to cool it down before I get in it. Then if I want to close them remotely I just hit the lock button twice and hold it down. It didn't come equipped with Mud Flaps which he said would be $98 for the Front and another $98 for the back installed before Sales Tax. He sold them to me for $122.00 including Tax and installation.

Chevy outfitted the Malibu with its latest and best technologies, including nine new safety features. Notably, there's a customizable Teen Driver feature that is standard on most trims. It mutes the audio when passengers aren't using seat belts and displays warnings when the car is going faster than pre-programmed speeds. It also generates a user report that displays the top speed, distance traveled and notes if any safety features were triggered during the drive. GM doesn't monitor or record the information, which can be deleted.

Other available safety features include a rear view camera, front pedestrian alert, lane keeping assist, active cruise control with automatic braking and Intellibeam automatic high-beam headlights. The car has 10 airbags as standard equipment. The Malibu will be sold in L, LS and LT trims. A new level, Premier, replaces LTZ as Chevy's new top trim. The Malibu goes on sale late this year, and the hybrid joins in spring 2016."
akirby,Apr-15,Teen Driver is the same as Ford's MyKey - several years later. They're also planning a regular hybrid (finally). This will be a solid competitor and much much much better than the current Malibu. Which incidentally will continue as a fleet model (which makes no sense other than pumping up sales volume).
benjaminh,Apr-15,That Malibu looks like another midsize car featuring poor rear visibility....
stickguy,Apr-15,"and short on rear head room.

back up camera and BLIS will be mandatory."
txboy,Apr-15,"I feel, in general, American brand has less visibility than foreign cars..is that right?"
akirby,Apr-15,"What is it that's behind you that you can't see? You can easily see vehicles behind you and you can't see things directly behind you close to the bumper no matter the design, so I really don't see why this is such a concern."
txboy,Apr-15,"I don't agree. The size of the windows and thickness of pillars would affect a lot in visibility and I think this matters in terms of driving safety. If you are in a mustang or camaro rather than Camry you can feel it is much darker inside. It means most of lights was blocked by the car frame and therefore you would see less things than it doesn't. Not only when you drive but also when you backing, or parking, with bad visibility, you may not see a pedestrian standing next to the car who hasn't notice you as well and possibly hit the person."
akirby,Apr-15,If you can't see a person in any new car you shouldn't be driving. At most it's an inconvenience.
mtnman1,Apr-15,"A couple of things I don't like about my new Fusion Hybrid that I didn't notice before I bought it. First off I am loving the mileage, the ride, the quiet cabin, and the looks of the car. What I am a little bothered about is when I got in it tuesday morning to go to work I noticed immediately the fact the two cup holder holes when I put a bottle of water in the driver's side of it that the bottle is in the way because of the gigantic center console right below the armrest. You can't have a insulated Coffee mug and a bottle of water occupying both holes and reach the steering wheel without having your right arm in your lap. I can get around it by myself, but when my wife and I travel it will be a problem. Also you don't have an accessory setting that will allow you to have everything off but the radio to listen to when the engine is off like when my wife runs in the store for a few things and it takes a half hour. It will stay on for about 5 to 10 minutes and shuts off. Still struggling to find a completely comfortable seating position. I think I got a bit closer today. Also the my Ford Touch is really a pain though easy to figure out. I am getting used to it more each day though. Lastly if you were a big person I think the front seat would be a bit tight width wise both for your legs and your hips. I am only 5' 10"" tall and 185 lbs so it's no problem for me. Would I buy it again if I had known these things. Yes."
akirby,Apr-15,If you touch the radio power button with the ignition off it will stay on for at least 1 hour.
explorerx4,Apr-15,Your wife could put her water bottle in the right door pocket and you can put you mug in the right side cup holder.
b25nut,Apr-15,"mtmman1 - I have to ditto your comments. After 29 months and 29K miles, I know my FFH is the best choice I could have made. Three oil changes and tire rotations have been the only work done on the car outside of the PCM update. The spring weather is giving me a 44 mpg average. The FFH is as good as whatever anyone considers to be the best mid-size sedan."
mtnman1,Apr-15,#akirby. Thanks for the tip about the radio. Justtried it this morning. Once the radio automatically shuts off about 5 - 10 minutes after the engine shuts down I just tap the radio on button. The salesman apparently didn't know this though he has sold Fords for years. Or he misunderstood my question.

Here's another one. If your wiper blades somehow get the wrong way, i.e. right one on top of left one, when the left one rises it will wait for the right one to pass before continuing. (or maybe the other way around - my car is downstairs in the garage and I'm too lazy to go down and look). For some reason, that amazes kids."

If you have your front wipers on but not the rear one, the rear one will wipe when the car is put into reverse. Now if only they could come up with a better name than ""courtesy wipe."""
mtnman1,Apr-15,"After just a few days I am getting really comfortable with the My Ford Touch as far as the functions. You can just about do everything through voice commands and the touch screen really only takes a quick glance to change things. Though I would recommend you use your voice is heavy traffic to change radio stations. I do think there are too many options for people as far as Using the Steering Wheel buttons. Using the Touch Screen, or Using Voice Commands. I can say it will be difficult for my Wife to use since she is not Tech Savvy in the slightest. She will probably stick with the Highlander to get around on weekends.

I can't say enough about the ride and how quiet the Cabin is on the road. So much more quiet than the other cars I test drove. This car is absolutely the best of them all. My 2009 had a great ride, but had more interior road noise. I do see one major difference when you choose not to get the Navigation is the Sound system. The Sony would have been really nice to have. My 2009 had the Audiophile system and it was fantastic so I got a bit spoiled. I have an amplifier and subwoofer that I had installed in the crappy system that was in my short term ownership of a 2011 Kia Sorento (traded after 21 months for the 2012 Highlander). That made a huge difference. I might have that installed because the bass is kind of weak in my new fusion system. I am an old hard rocker that likes new stuff like on Sirius Octane and old rock like Led Zeppelin."

Yeah. That's a funky name.That's what they call (I think) the last pass of the wipers on my Fusion when you're cleaning the windshield. When you pull the stalk to spray on the windshield it will wipe three times, wait a few seconds, and do one last wipe. I thought it was silly at first, but it does get that last trickle that always seems to stream down after you think you are done.The thing has three spray jets too."

I found the same thing as far as My Ford Touch. Although a little intimidating at first, you find the few dozen things you use. It's unfairly criticized, as far as I'm concerned, by reviewers who only spend a little time driving the car - although it is, supposedly, much better than it was originally.

My wife is still amazed when it reads out text messages.

A little advice. If you ever need to replace the windshield, get an OEM Ford windshield. A lot of the quietness is because of the glass.

Mine has the Sony system and you're right, it's pretty sweet."
nyccarguy,Apr-15,@mtnman1 - congrats on your FFH purchase. Beautiful car in a beautiful color. Enjoy!
nyccarguy,Apr-15,"I just did a Fuel Economy test this past tankful. I set my cruise control at 65 for the most part. Traffic has been relatively light on the local roads & some extra highway time to and from Long Island. 495.5 miles on 17.17 gallons of RUG (87 octane) yielded me a best yet 28.9 mpg. Interesting that the trip computer showed I got 31 mpg. I crossed over the 11,000 mile mark in just over 6 months.

My legacy continues to be a comfortable commuter for me. The only thing I do wish for is some more giddy up. The CVT makes the best of the 2.5's 175 horsepower, but merging uphill from a complete stop onto the highway with a short ramp (common in NY & CT) requires some extra planning."
stickguy,Apr-15,"Man, I hated some of those no-merge parkway on ramps in Westchester. Was especially fun in the old days with cars like a 68HP Colt."

explorerx4,Apr-15,"@mtnman1, You'll fit right in at Ohio State games."
explorerx4,Apr-15,"Sitting in the car wash, noticed the odometer read 22222.2"
explorerx4,Apr-15,"Fusion is in the body shop to get a new fender.
My rental is a 2015 Malibu LTZ.
The electronics are somewhat confusing to me, but that's probably because I am used to how Ford does theirs.
Ride is definitely softer than the Fusion. I fixed the tire pressures, so tomorrow I'll get a better idea of the handling. Left front was down 6lbs from right rear. It has a nice display showing the individual tire pressures.
At first, I thought something was wrong with the drivetrain, but figured out that it has start/stop.
Once you understand what's going on, I kind like having it. It does make a kind of metallic sound and you feel a slight vibration, but nothing too intrusive.
More to follow."
explorerx4,Apr-15,"Learned a few more things about the Malibu today. Start/stop doesn't begin until the engine is warmed up. There is a small battery, motorcycle sized in the trunk used to control the start/stop system.
There is a small button built into the CHMSL to open the trunk, but you can't open it from inside the car.
MPG's look pretty good, once I figured out how to display them.
The floor shift is a bit strange. All the way forward, it lines up with the 'P' for park, but after that, it seems like it moves twice as far as how many lights are indicated. When in 'R' the shift is next to the 'N'. When In 'N' it is next to 'M' (after D).
I like the power window switch location better then my Fusion."
shabadoo25,Apr-15,"I just leased a 2015 Hyundai Sonata Sport 2.0T in Lakeside (Royal) Blue. With the March incentives and usual discounts, I got almost 6k off the sticker price of $29700.

I am coming from a BMW 328i and currently don't feel like I gave up much considering 2 of these cars sale price is still less than the MSRP of the Bimmer. The stereo system is better in the Hyundai and I had the Harmon Kardon in the 328i."
explorerx4,Apr-15,"Turned in the Malibu yesterday. I only put about 80 miles on it in 3 days, but it's a pretty good car.
It was a 2015 LTZ model, highest trim level.
Sat in the back seat, just to try it out, with the front seat set for me. It pretty much felt the same as my Fusion.
Overall, other than the handing/ride not being as tight as my Fusion it was a pretty good car.
It was a N/A 4 cyl, so it didn't have the power of my Fusion. but it was fine for anything I put it through.
Indicated mileage was right around 30, which is a bit higher than the Fusion.
Really interested to see how the next gen model fares."
mtnman1,Apr-15,I have driven 1000 miles on my new Fusion in the 2 1/2 weeks I have owned it. Filled up for the second time yesterday. Drove 486.1 miles divided by 11.382 gallons which means I got 42.71 MPG on it. The Car's computer said 43.4 so it was not off by much. This is in mixed driving. Anywhere from stop and go to driving 70+ mph. Compared to the 20.5 I was getting in my old Fusion I am very satisfied with my purchase decision. Such a beautiful car to drive and yet it has great gas mileage. Glad I happened to walk the Dealership lot while I got a new headlamp installed on my old one or I would have bought something else.
explorerx4,Apr-15,"Now that the weather has warmed up, my Fusion 2.0 is back up to 28+ mpg indicated on the computer.
I did fill up last time with PUG. It's supposed to make more power, but not increase fuel mileage.
The car does not downshift on a big hill I go up about a mile from home, and the engine seems to run a bit smoother. I won't have to fill up until next week, so I don't know what the prices will be by then."
stickguy,Apr-15,"just took a short trip this past weekend with my Sonata (philly to Baltimore and back). About 250 miles I think. Largely highway, with a few backups on 95 (of course) and a little bit of local in the middle. overall, just under 34 per the computer, which based on previous experience meant I got an actual 33 or so. Not bad for the trip I did. I will take that. Was not babying it either most of the way.

best couple of trips (NY to Philly) have been just over 35. Really happy with that."

To be fair to Toyota, it sounds like those transmission characteristics were there when they bought the car and could have been deciphered during a reasonable test drive. Or is the claim that the transmission has two personalities and is bi-Polar?"
explorerx4,May-15,"Back from my trip to Cleveland. My Fusion 2.0 makes more power on PUG, but it isn't supposed to increase the fuel mileage.
My philosophy(big word), has been to buy RUG for a trip, since I would burn through it in a few hours.

The additional power is where you need it, on the hills. The engine runs smoother, too.
On an everyday basis, I don't need it and it doesn't seem to make a difference."

""....Lending a more athletic look to each of the models seen here are new grilles, bumpers, decklid garnishes, headlamps, and taillamps—including multi-element, Acura-style LED headlamps on the Touring model that prove that the sexy lights on the Honda Civic Coupe concept shown last month at the New York auto show were no fluke. Here’s hoping they appear on the production 2016 Civic, as well. The Accord’s wheel designs are also new, and we particularly like the big five-spoke pieces seen in some of the shots.

Apparently the Adaptive Cruise Control and the other Honda Sensing features will be available for about $1000, which seems like a fair price."
ral2167,Jun-15,All cars have blind spots.. unless you turn your head and look.
thebean,Jun-15,"The new grille on the Accord looks Camryesque to me, which is not a good look to me.  Love all the added features however, like 60/40 rear seat and Homelink."
benjaminh,Jun-15,"ral2167 said:

Agreed. And that's what I mean. If you turn your head and look you have excellent rear visibility in the Accord. With other midsize cars, such as the Kia Optima, the very thick rear roof pillars mean you still have a blind spot even if you look behind you."
benjaminh,Jun-15,Is Homelink a built-in garage door opener?
benjaminh,Jun-15,"This is a nice group of new features for the EX:
+ LED Tail Lights

The EX 6MT currents starts at $25k msrp. Wonder what this will add. Given how competitive the market is, I'm guessing and hoping for a c. $500 increase. Normally you'd probably say all of this stuff is worth close to a grand, but I don't think the market would take kindly to an increase like that.

I wonder what the Enhanced Display Audio stuff is? Is that to display song and title on FM stations etc.?

I think they might also add the electronic parking brake now found not only on the Acura TLX, but also on the new HR-V."
benjaminh,Jun-15,"19"" wheels for the Sport!?"

benjaminh,Jun-15,"Since my wife gets our one car garage for her 2013 Accord, the remote start is potentially an appealing feature to me. On icy or snowy winter days, rather than going out to the car I could start the melting process from inside the house while sipping my coffee. Sounds nice! My 2008 Accord EXL navi has c. 73k miles on it, and really nothing is wrong with it, but....in 6 months or so I might consider a successor. The new features on the Accord make it appealing to me."
suydam,Jun-15,So the only distinguishing feature of EX-L will be leather?
benjaminh,Jun-15,"Yeah, that is a puzzler....But I guess you also get the premium stereo, as well as all of the ""Honda Sensing"" features as standard."

benjaminh,Jun-15,"Automobile Magazine's new midsize comparison....

http://www.automobilemag.com/reviews/driven/1506-midsize-madness-2015-mazda6-accord-sonata-camry-legacy-comparison/

5. Toyota Camry

Bottom line? We respect the 2015 Toyota Camry far more than we like it. Thanks to its evergreen reputation for reliability and quality, it remains the best car to recommend to people who forget what they drive once they park it. Conversely, Toyota seems to rely on return buyers who will trade in their old Camrys for new ones every three years. Despite the face-lift, the car has fallen behind the midsize state-of-the-art in terms of rich, sumptuous interiors and technical advances. If your 2012 Toyota Camry is still running like a top, it’s probably worth waiting for the all-new 2018 model.

4. Subaru Legacy

“Plenty of Camry buyers would do well to shop for a Legacy instead,” Capparella says. “It’s not more interesting than the Toyota, but offers some significant improvements in terms of interior style, visibility, fuel efficiency, and its AWD, while it retains all the strengths that make the Toyota so popular.”Weiner finds the exclusive AWD feature the Legacy’s only advantage.“It’s not a bad car, especially considering how similar all these midsizers are, but it is the most blandly styled in a segment replete with vanilla,” Weiner says. “The interior feels cheap, with flat seats, plasticky buttons and a generally hollow, budget feel to the cabin.”


3.Hyundai Sonata

The 2015 Hyundai Sonata provides a compelling combination of Mazda6 distinction, Honda Accord value, and Toyota Camry roominess. It’s the midsize sedan we’d most recommend to friends and family who care most about comfort and convenience and don’t mind a little extra style in their automotive appliances.

2. Honda Accord

Our perennial favorite, the 2015 Honda Accord nearly stole the show with its combination of predictable chassis dynamics, a capacious interior, and classic low-cowl outward visibility, which makes it an exceptionally easy car to drive in any traffic. The car emphasizes design simplicity, and it is not overtly sporty. It is very well mannered. “Better steering than the Mazda’s,” Weiner says. “It’s a bit quicker and more fluid. The design is perhaps showing its age a little, but everything in this car is easy to engage with. Most of the time I am not thinking much while driving this one, but when I do I’m impressed with it. Fantastic ride/handling balance....”

1. Mazda6

We agreed the Mazda6 is the sleekest, best-looking sedan here, though the outward visibility and rear seat package suffer as a result. To make a sedan look this rakish without severely compromising headroom, designers raise the beltline between the B- and C-pillars, which creates a sort of cavernous effect for rear-seat passengers. Though the Mazda6 has an overtly sporting flavor, we’d rate the 2.5-liter Skyactiv-G inline-four engine -- and the car’s well-balanced ride and handling dynamics -- within a hair of the Honda Accord either way. “It’s the only one of the bunch that could even remotely be called a sport sedan,” Capparella says. “There’s a fluidity to the handling that even the Accord can’t match."""

Having driven both types of BSM, I disagree.  The Honda system is much more effective for me.  YMMV."
stickguy,Jun-15,"I love the BLIS monitor on the Sonata. even with mirrors set, sometimes you miss something (especially in the dark or bad weather). Doesn't replace checking, but it is a great backup system.

the rear cross-path is also very helpful for when you get stuck between a couple of trucks and have to back up mostly blind out of a parking spot."
brian125,Jun-15,"The handling is superior in the mazda6. Radio is better , back up camera is worse than Accords. I agree with the review. Also to much road noise in the Mazda6 , No upgrade engines, not enough h/p in the 4cyl. for me. Seats are uncomfortable for a 6' plus person. Mazda6 is smaller inside with visibility not as good. The Accord is hands down a better vehicle in my eye having owned one. Mazda6 is a good clean sharp car that has a lot of positives on its side. Its not going to cut it as a family sedan ... What ever your preference is ................... that's what counts.

The Toyota Camry seats are very comfortable I like them better than my old Accord or the Mazda6

Honda's BSM is the best feature out there right now. The blinking mirror sensor is ok."
ral2167,Jun-15,Honda BSM is the worst feature. You press a button and then look at a screen to see if there's a car on the passenger side. Or you turn your signal on and look at the screen. How is either of these choices better than just looking for a light on the passenger side mirror? Am I nuts?
suydam,Jun-15,"You use your turn signal when you are changing lanes. The camera goes on automatically. It's very useful when changing into a right lane because you are already looking that direction. That said, my Buick has the Blinking sensor and rear cross traffic alert which are both extremely helpful. Honda, however, for its part has Forward Collision Alert which is useful too. I wish the car companies would standardize all these safety features!"
benjaminh,Jun-15,"Seems like there's something of a midsize price/financing battle going on at the moment. Nissan, for instance, has all sorts of incentives on the Altima, including 0% financing for up to 72 months. I've had the Altima as a rental car a few times, and it seems second-rate to me in all sorts of ways. But there's no denying that it gives you a lot of bang for the buck:

stickguy,Jun-15,"yeah, from my shopping around, the Camry and Altima are the 2 that are really cheap to lease. And for basic, reliable, roomy and economical transportation, perfect choices.

though if you can afford a little bit more per month, can get into a Sonata, Fusion, or a 6 instead. then an Accord. But the Accord is always going to be more.

Just have to avoid models with any options on them!"

benjaminh,Jun-15,"20 years ago a Ford T-Bird with the optional V-8 had the stats below. Today some of our 4-cylinder midsize sedans with the standard engines will outperform it:

""The 4.6 L V8 produced 205 horsepower (153 kW) at 4500 rpm and 265 lb·ft (359 N·m) of torque at 3200 rpm and brought with it an updated powertrain control module, the EEC-V (base V6 Thunderbirds and Super Coupes continued to use the older EEC-IV). An electronically controlled 4R70W 4-speed automatic transmission replaced the AOD automatic transmission in all instances where it was previously used in the Thunderbird. Car and Driver reviewed the 4.6 L V8 and it managed a 0 to 60 mph acceleration time of 8.1 seconds and a quarter-mile being completed in 16.3 seconds at 87 mph."""

nyccarguy,Jun-15,"The modern, turbocharged, direct injected, 4 cylinders out on the market today are nice engines. Although I think DI engines need new spark plugs at 50K ((I could be wrong). Coupled with today's 6 + speed automatic & CVT transmissions there is almost no ""need"" for a 6 cylinder. My Legacy's power is adequate, but the CVT really makes the most of its 175 horsepower. My car would be slower than death with a conventional 4-Speed Automatic from say 10 years ago.

No matter how powerful, torquey, & efficient a turbo 4 is, some people just prefer a 6. A few years ago my dentist was looking to get rid of his 2002 A4 3.0 Quattro. He decided he liked the Q5. He drove the 2.0T and the 3.2 back to back. He said he liked the smoothness of the 3.2L V6 better.

I just filled up the Legacy tonight with 420 miles on the tank. It still read 70 to go. I got a respectable 27 mpg."

If I remember correctly: Did your parents have the Porsche Cayenne before the X-5?

Did they upgrade to a newer model or change brands? My 2012 X-5 ( 2nd one ) I 'm going to dump off soon for a 2016 model. I'm tossed between another X-5 or going Audi Q or SQ5. The X-3 is ok but need it loaded to excite me @55k..... Why bother.

Not many folks here own a X-5 so feedback for me is limited."

Yes, they owned a 2011 V6 Cayenne which they traded in for a 2013 X5 35i Premium. Their 2013 is not the current body style, but is the same as yours. Im sorry i cant give you much in the way of feedback on the new model. Maintenance costs for the Cayenne were insanely high. They spent close to 10% of the car's original sticker price on maintenance during the 2 1/2 years & 55K miles they owned it.

I can tell you that they are far from thrilled with the X5. Once it is out of warranty, they will most likely dump it. For what, I have NO IDEA. They will both tell you hands down that the Cayenne is a much nicer driving vehicle."

benjaminh,Jun-15,"What's the farthest you've ever gone on one tank of gas in your midsize car? We just had a highway trip where we went 560 miles on a tank of gas in our 2013 Accord, and we still had one more gallon in the tank."
suydam,Jun-15,"At about 520 I tend to fill the tank. But on a trip to Kalamazoo, which is only 300 miles from me, I had plenty to drive there, spend 4 days doing in town driving, and drive back past Toledo before I finally got gas. I think that was around 550."
stickguy,Jun-15,"about 400 miles on my Sonata, but that was not on a longer trip. I also get gas at about 1/4 (or sooner) and don't push it. I don't plan to ever find out where the low fuel light is on my car.

when I fill up, even after doing mixed driving, the RTE is usually just over 500 miles."
nyccarguy,Jun-15,522.7 miles is the furthest I've ever gone on one tank in my Legacy. I also ran out of gas about a mile from the closest gas station on that tankful
robr2,Jun-15,"I had a Sonata as a rental last week in San Francisco/Sacramento. It got about 27 mpg and 427 miles before I filled up. The DTE said I still had 50 miles but I was on the way to the airport to return it.

I get similar mileage with my Passat but range is not nearly as good as the fuel tank is only 15 gallons. I'm guessing the Sonata has about an 18 gallon tank."
Michaell,Jun-15,A new driver started at the pizza place where I moonlight. Drives a new Sonata Hybrid. She tells me she gets close to 600 miles on a tank - she commutes about 60 miles a day to Denver and back.
stickguy,Jun-15,"Sonata tank us 18.5. In my experience, based on how much it takes to fill, the DTE is very conservative. Either that, or it never a fills all the way!"
robr2,Jun-15,"Although I posted my results, the ""miles per tank"" is a poor tool for comparison as not all cars have the same tank size. I get a similar miles per tank (300-350) in all my cars but the tank sizes differ:

Passat 15 gallon
Odyssey 18 gallon
Explorer 20 gallon.

I guess it matters if you take many road trips as fewer stops for fuel would be required. Then again, my bladder has a much lower distance to full than any of my cars have distance to empty."
robr2,Jun-15,"As for the Sonata, this was a rental from Hertz via Hotwire. I paid $125 including taxes for 5 days out of SFO. The car had 55K miles on it and new tires. This is twice in a row I've gotten a rental via Hotwire at Hertz that had over 50K miles. I wonder if they keep a couple of cars out back for us cheap Hotwire renters.

Anyway, it was comfortable for the 500 or so miles I drove. Air vents are pretty bad for holding my phone mount. Plastics were very hard. The media system took a while to figure out so I could pair my phone. Parallel parking is tough. It needs backup sensors. Trunk was huge and it swallowed my carryon and laptop bag. It accelerated just fine then again in SF and Sacramento Valley traffic, 0-60 isn't the most important feature.

Overall, it was fine for a rental. I wouldn't buy one as the styling has gotten stale IMHO."
stickguy,Jun-15,"Was this a new style 15 or a old 14? With that mileage I guess old style.

backy,Jun-15,"On a trip to Texas and back last December, I did some 400+ mile segments before filling up, but bladders gave out before the gas tank. Given the ~37 mpg we averaged on the trip, with some days on the highway better than that, and the 18.5 gallon tank, it would have been pretty easy to exceed 600 miles on a tank. But when you gotta go, you gotta go!"

She offered me a Q50 and I said sure. Then she said the rate was double. So she offered me a Cruze. I told her I would take the Mustang. All of a sudden, no Mustang. She offered me a Cruze. I told her my rate was for a standard size car (Chrysler 200 or equal) and that's what I wanted at a minimum. When I booked through Hotwire and got that rate, I checked Hertz' site directly and the same car class was $90 a day."

I had a 1979 Mustang 5.0. It had only 140 HP (pronounced five point slow) and it had about 200 lb ft. My father bought it for me on my 18th birthday from some small independent dealer. The second day I had it the heater core blew up and poured coolant out of the vents so I quickly pulled over and shut the car off, fearing the worst. My father built the owner of the dealer's house, so they cut the price $500 which brought it down to $1,000. Then in the morning my car was gone. He said it is getting fixed but it would take a week. A week? That was an eternity back then. Anyway, what actually happened was the dealer knew the auto shop supervisor at Lorton prison. So, two weeks go by, and finally I come home from school, and my dad just handed me the keys. I went out to the garage where I turned on the light..... and was speechless. They totally hooked me up. It had an SVO hood, painted red with two black stripes split around it. The rest of the car was dark metallic red w/ metal flake, double black stripes down the hood and all the way back the new spoiler. They rebuilt the top end of the engine, added dual exhaust, removed the A/C compressor, (too much $ and killed HP). And the piece de resistance- 4 Cragars and Pirelli P-Zero tires. I think the got the power up to 200zxxs and the torque was around 270. To top off, I was handed a bag with chrome 5.0 badges, and an SVO sticker. I put the SVO dead center on the spoiler, along with the 5.0 badges where they were supposed to go. The car had heat again too! Anyway.... to an 18year old kid I was shocked and surprised. Loved it till I was offered a deal I couldn't refuse and sold it before the knocking sound (lower engine problem) got louder. It was sold to a Mechanic and I am sure its still out there on the road....


Also Ben, Do you remember the. 88-92 Lincoln Mark VII? It had the Mustang 5.0 SEFI 225 HP V8, and a whopping (at the time) 300 lb ft. My favorite was the 89 with the digital dash, the LSC performance trim, and by default, the 4speed AOD trans. The car mags loved it.... and so did I."

""2016 Acura ILX A-Spec First Test Review
Could This Be Acura's Most Engaging Car?

....The ILX feels more athletic. Even before you turn on the ignition, the seats are noticeably firmer. During spirited driving, the generous thigh support holds you tightly in place, and the stiff suspension and sharp brakes enhance the sensation. Steering has tightened, and corners come pleasurably and effortlessly. It isn't the fastest beast around, but it's still quite fun listening to the engine growl as the sedan slips past other cars on the highway. All 201 hp is routed seamlessly through an eight-speed dual clutch that really had us surprised. This butter-smooth transmission is always eager to move up to a higher gear even if you only lightly press on the gas, and once you hit 25 mph, you're already in fifth. When slowing down, the gearbox downshifts so effortlessly you'd never think it's a dual clutch....

Perhaps the ILX's biggest accomplishment when it comes to refinement is its sound insulation. For 2016, Acura installed thicker front-door side glass and more insulation for the body panels for a quieter ride. We tested the car's active noise control on some of the roughest and noisiest highways in Los Angeles, and although it's not perfectly soundproofed, it keeps the cabin pretty quiet, especially compared to other cars in its class. Overall, expect a smooth ride that won't succumb to road imperfections, but also expect the ILX to feel a bit like a sports car thanks to its firm suspension. We expect the refreshed ILX would be more mature for 2016. But who knew maturity could also be so much fun? ....A fresh new design, buttery dual-clutch transmission, plentiful standard features, and engaging driving dynamics make a strong case for this entry-level luxer.""

They measure 0-60 in 6.8 seconds. I think C & D was a bit quicker."

The Camry might not be my particular cup of tea, but Toyota definitely has a thing going.  I saw a livery cab last week - 2010 Camry Hybrid - with over 252,000 miles in the odometer.

The suspension is very well calibrated.  The ride is comfortable and well controlled without being isolated and wallowy.  The Legacy isn't a sports car or even a sports sedan.  There is definitely more body roll than in an Accord or a Mazda 6, but that doesn't mean the Legacy doesn't handle well.  Thetorque vectoring AWD system makes sure the car goes where you intend.  If you can get up to speed, it has no problem carrying that speed into a corner.

I like the interior.  Layout is simple and materials are high grade, especially given the car's sub $25K sticker price.  The only thing I don't like is the fake aluminum trim piece (silver plastic) that runs the entire length of the dashboard."
ab348,Jul-15,Online reviewers of cars have bias and play favorites? I'm SHOCKED!!!!
akirby,Jul-15,In other news...water is still wet.
explorerx4,Jul-15,"This guy recently reviewed a bunch of mid size sedans.

stickguy,Jul-15,"well, I'm not expecting much, since he put the Camry 2, and the 200 3 places ahead of the Sonata!"
suydam,Jul-15,I thought they were good reviews. He had his preferences but he acknowledged the strengths of other cars in the class. It was very informative. Thanks for the post!
explorerx4,Jul-15,"@suydam,
It's not often you find a 10 car comparison even if it's not technical. I find interesting that a different car gets the best fuel mileage in each comparison review I read."
shabadoo25,Jul-15,"I read his review of the Sonata first since I drive one, and now I don't have to bother with the rest. The following things are not accurate:

1. The SE model is not mid range, it is entry level.
2. Prices for Camrys and Accords are similar."

On noise: My stereo is so loud that noise is a low priority for me when buying. If the stereo is off, then the kids are all blabbing so low noise level is still just not a priority.

On style: The new 2015 Sonata has grown on me, but on the Mazda.... based on my expert exterior stylists, aged 10, 13, and 14- the Mazda looks ""just like yours daddy"".

Visibility: My car has a high beltline like the Sonata it is cloned from, but it doesn't bother me, except in reverse. Those replacement rear view mirror camera's have come down in price. Maybe a good X-Mas present. I now have 41,960 miles on my 2012 Optima EX.

Reliability: After 3.5 years of service it has not left me stranded once, and my high pressure fuel pump was promptly replaced when it died in one hour with zero hassle. I brought my car in for the recall on it promptly, but two weeks later it died. The car still ran and got me to the dealer, as it has a low pressure fuel pump as well They said mine must have been too far gone and too late to re-calibrate, and it was replaced under warranty. I beat the crap out of the throttle so I totally understand why the 16,000 PSI Direct Injection pump died after 40k. Also,let me repeat that there was the low pressure pump that kept it running until I could get her to the dealer.

Side note on Kia's one step down Forte: My mom (77) has a 2010 EX. Her tires were replaced for free; and they hooked her up with Hankook;s instead of Nexens. No charge. They washed, waxed, and did a great job cleaning it out. All I had to do was add a Mothers Gold Sealer Wax and some Rain-X to help out her new wiper blades-and some tire foam. Looks brand new.

Overall my car still looks like new as well. It drives like new, and even though it's not fast, has frightening brakes and understeers like crazy, there is something fun about winding out a slow car and having fun with the sport shifter on entrance/exit ramps and windy country roads...which are getting harder and harder to find here in the DMV area.

Finally, financials. How much do I owe? $8400. How much is she worth avg trade in good condition? $14200.

I'm very happy with my '12 Optima EX, Mom's happy with the '10 Forte' EX. Just FYI on Kia's sedans: They are not as refined as some competitors, but learning quickly."

A lot of rationalizing and excuse making for Kia on that one coming from you. Unless you cut a hole in your floor boards so that you could ""beat"" your throttle past its design range of motion, there is no excuse for that early failure.That being said, if that's the only part replaced in the first 3 years and 42K miles I would still call that good reliability.As to the noise issue, it goes up the scale of importance if you care about sound quality when you are playing your stereo loudly. The less noise the better for higher sound quality; regardless of your volume setting."

I think you might be a bit high on that estimate. I see 2012 Optima EXs with ~40k miles advertised at local Kia dealers for around $14k, retail. That's well below the KBB retail value, but that's not unusual to see used car prices tracking below KBB. KBB has the Optima EX with 42k miles in Good condition at between $12,169-12,876 Trade-In value. But I don't know where you live and don't know what options your car has. But for sure you can trade it in for a lot more than you owe!

The lease is up on my wife's 2013 Sonata GLS in November, and I see prices tracking lower than the buy-out value, even considering the low miles on the car (just 23k now after 32 months). So I wouldn't buy the car after the lease is up, even if we weren't planning on getting an SUV to replace it."
berri,Jul-15,I wonder if finding the dealer asking price for a comparable used model and subtracting 3 grand or so is a more realistic estimating tool for your trade ins? I think an awful lot of the website estimates are higher than real experiences.
[Deleted User],Jul-15,"I am just repeating what the Sheehy Ford Appraiser said to me directly. You should note that there is all Kia branded aftermarket equipment I added that does actually count. They don't have to remove some boy racer crap/intake system, it has great condition tires, new brakes, all work done at dealer, and 1 owner who already had the notoriously fail prone fuel pump replaced. Plus it still has 2.5 years and 20k of warranty left (not sure if my B2B 10/100 warranty will transfer). You may have seen lots of 2012 Kia Optima LX models for $14,990, but not an EX with a lot of Kia produced goodies. I have the rubber tray in the trunk, 2 sets of floor mats.....one type weather tech with ""optima"" on them and one regular set of carpeted ones I have never used. Then there is the legal tinted windows and the Spicy red color with lots of tlc with mothers gold. There is a small ding-ent which is almost invisible....but I filled the scrapes with scratch remover and re-applied mothers gold...still, they found it and that is the only reason it didn't get ""Excellent"" rating

I hope folks understand that DI fuel pumps are under 16,000 PSI of pressure.This is not some fuel pump off an 86 Cavalier that should last 150k. My car does have one of those type though....it is for cruising and THAT is part of how it gets over 30mpg. It is also how I was able to finish my repair jobs, a trip to Walmart, and then to the dealer for repair of the high pressure Fuel pump. So, it technically never left me stranded."

You have to move to a Sonata SE to get to the equipment levels equivalent in the Optima EX..although some come with heated seats and other goodies as part of a premium package. You might be right though, as I was interested in the 2015 Mustang with the 2.3 Ecoboost Premium Package with 320 HP and 320 lb ft. All for $26,999, and there were no incentives, rebates, or any interest in dickering...so thats why the high trade in) I found out though for 2016 they are going to tweak the Ecoboost (turbo 4) motor and the V6 will be the base model, the Ecoboost 2.3 Premium will be the everyman's weekend barnstorming version, and the GT the ultimate 2 door rear drive full on sports car that the rest of us can't afford the price and insurance on. I drove the V6 Mustang....don't even think about buying one. the 3.7 was gritty and unsatisfying. I bet Ford drops it or it will be put out to rental car pasture. I drove the 2.3 Ecoboost. OMG. No need for the 5.0 or the insurance and cost to go with it. Too bad my kids have legs.Since I just made a $500 payment, I am down to $7,900 or so. I am SO EXCITED to pay it off!!!>"
andres3,Jul-15,Is the 5.0 really that much more costly to insure than the 2.3?
roadburner,Jul-15,"High insurance? I had my agent run some numbers on a few cars, and a new GT is a whopping $39 more per year than a new Mini Cooper S- and $126 less than a 2012 135is. If I land on the Mustang I'm going with six speed GT Performance Package or not at all; I'm not buying a car that's significantly slower than my current DD. As I see it, the GT is ludicrously cheap- a screaming performance bargain."
akirby,Jul-15,Well all Mustangs are 6 speeds so that doesn't mean anything. I assume you meant manual?

I will respectfully disagree with you about modern CVTs. Wife and I bought a 2015 Outback 3.6R in February that is equipped with a CVT. Through the miracle of modern computers, it ""feels"" like a regular transmission; that is, you feel the gear changes as you accelerate. What I find really nice is that when you are on cruise and encounter a hill, there is no downshifting necessary to maintain your speed; the tach increases a few hundred RPMs and all is well.Paddle shifters allow for manual control through 6 pre-set ""gears"", which is great for bad weather here in Colorado. Downshifting rather than using the brakes when going down steep hills allows you to maintain control.We averaged about 28MPG on a recent 1700 mile road trip, where we were doing 80-85 on the interstate.The car has only 6000 miles on it so far, so I can't speak to longevity or maintenance costs just yet."
akirby,Jul-15,Actually a CVT has almost infinite gear ratios so it would be an Infinity speed rather than a zero speed. If you start considering fuel economy rather than driving feel you'll get a much different opinion of the CVTs.
andres3,Jul-15,"akirby said:

I think the CVT is efficient when considering just fuel economy, if, and this is a BIG IF, you are light footed on the accelerator. In my real world more than a week long rental experience with a recent model Altima, I had to be so heavy footed to move out of my own way that my real world gas mileage fell way below the EPA estimates. It fell significantly more below EPA estimates than I would traditionally fall below EPA estimates in a rental with my typical driving style."

I think the Subaru CVT is superior to most other CVT's out there, other than maybe Honda's in my opinion. It is borderline for me, I would consider a Forester with it, which means I'm not outright outlawing it. Audi's and Nissans versions didn't do anything for me.

I think your mileage is very impressive given the Outback is a fairly large vehicle and you have the big V6 engine. I believe your 3.6R helps the CVT work better than the 2.5. I think your 3.6 has similar output to Subaru's new 2.0T as in the new Forester XT. That engine might be even better than you think, but you just don't realize it with the CVT.

However, I would find it very interesting to hear you opinion if Subaru would make you a custom vehicle exactly the same as you recently purchased, but with VW's DSG transmission unit in it instead of the CVT. I think the differences might surprise you, and you just might change your mind. I think Subaru needs to pay VW/Audi to license that DSG unit; they could still make and try to sell their CVT at a lower cost point. It would certainly make the STI more appealing to me as a daily driver."

The 3.6 H-6 engine in our Outback makes 253HP, so very similar to the 2.0T found in the Forester XT.

I, too, was surprised at the mileage we achieved on our road trip last month. EPA lists the car at 20/27, so we got the highway number pretty much on the nose.

I have test driven a VW CC with the DSG transmission; I wasn't terribly impressed with it, especially in around town driving. Felt jerky when moving away from a stop. Perhaps with more time and experience, I might feel differently. If I were ever to get a GTI, it would be equipped with a stick shift."

How long ago did you test drive that VW CC? I know in recent years it seems the DSG thinks it's a regular smooth slushbox in D mode. S mode is another animal. I suppose it comes down to tastes, your complaint about smoothness isn't the first I've heard regarding DSG, To me, I like the direct mechanical immediate feel (that some might find jerky). I prefer that to lag and delay."
suydam,Jul-15,"I've had a Honda Accord CVT for 2 years. It drives no differently than any other car I've owned. Plenty of power. Gets nearly 40 mpg on my trips across the Pennsylvania turnpike and a breeze going up and down those steep hills. That said, I found the Nissan CVT to be significantly different -- extremely noisy when first accelerating especially. I was a passenger in the new Corolla a friend was looking at, and that CVT seemed more similar to the Honda. I haven't driven the Subaru. So I don't think you can generalize about CVTs as a group."

Can't remember exactly, but probably 2 or 3 years ago. It's entirely possible that the software that controls it has been upgraded since then.

When I'm ready to lease my next car towards the end of next year, I plan to test drive a whole lot of different offerings. I'll see if I can include a newer model VW with the DSG among them."
akirby,Jul-15,"DSGs can be jerky although the current ones are light years ahead of the first ones. The weirdest thing on my daughter's 2012 Focus is when you're backing up and let off the accelerator it freewheels with no engine braking. Just feels strange.

I also found that you need to drive them hard every once in a while to keep the clutches cleaned off.

Now the ones in the Ferrari 458 Italia and the Porsche 911 GT3 that I drove on a racetrack - absolute perfection. Then again they probably cost as much as a Focus."
benjaminh,Jul-15,"Honda Accord gets styling update, new features:

http://www.caranddriver.com/news/2016-honda-accord-photos-and-info-news

2015 Accord EX vs. 2016 Accord EX

Looks like a lot of added features at this level compared to the current model: HD radio, split folding rear seat, restyle/aluminum hood/new wheels, better smart phone integration/larger screen, XM, remote start, Homelink, LED fogs/DRLs/ tail lights, etc.

Probably the biggest thing is the capability for Apple iPhone CarPlay and Android Auto to work on the new software with bigger screen.

I'm getting used to the new styling and beginning to like it.

Some very nice upgrades for me, at least in terms of how much I would would pay for these things, but I'm hoping for an increase of only $500 or so. We'll see.

Anyway, here's how I'd value these thing, in just a very subjective ""what they're worth to me"" way.

HD radio: $100
split folding seat: $200
new styling/wheels: $300
larger screen/CarPlay: $300
XM: $100
remote start: $300 (we have a one car garage, and my wife gets it)
Homelink: $100
LEDs: $200

For me, anyway, it seems to add up to a c. $1600 upgrade. Even though great discounts are available on the 2015s, for me personally I think it's worth waiting.

But my current ride, a 2008 Accord with 75k miles, is completely paid off, and has been since I bought it. Don't have the money now to buy a new car like that, although my credit is still excellent and I could do a downpayment in addition to the trade. But my current Accord has relatively new tires and nothing really wrong with, and so I'll probably keep it for another year or two."

One vehicle with a great CVT is the Ford Fusion Hybrid. I took many test drives in the Legacy and one in the Accord. Both were 4 cylinders. Loved the Legacy. Hated the Accord. It came down to the vehicle with the best ride for me. I thought that I would never own a CVT, but now I don't notice it. Sure I miss the power of the V6 I had in my 2009 Fusion, but I'm loving the increased mileage and just a great all around vehicle."

More details on the significant upgrades for the 2016 Honda Accord. In addition to the restyle, and adding the 7"" touchscreen with ability to do Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, Honda has also strengthened the structure of the Accord (which was already best-in-class), as well as improved the steering and suspension.

The 19"" wheels for the Sport still look a bit freaky to me, but for younger buyers esp. there's almost certainly a market for such extreme stuff.

nocho,Jul-15,"Hey, guys, great topic - a lot of exciting stuff! Me, I've always been a fan of Toyota's brands - Camry and Corolla. Something tells me that the newest editons are gonna be even better - can't wait to get myself a 2016 Camry. Couldn't find any good info about it (besides edmonds) - anybody got some reliable sources? I'd really appreciate that. Happened upon this italkaboutcars.com blog - seems decent enough,learned a lot about the 2015-16 + hybrid versions, but still, not a lot of new details, Holla if you've got some new, reliable information."
benjaminh,Jul-15,"Welcome, nocho.

The 2015 Camry was substantially revised and updated (see review from Edmunds below), and so it's unlikely there will be many (or even any) changes for 2016. The Camry is considered reliable, safe, and a good value, but in most comparison tests with other midsize cars the Camry ranks toward the bottom. Would you consider alternatives, or are you settled on Toyota?

""Full Expert Review: 2015 Toyota Camry

What's New for 2015

The Toyota Camry receives a thorough overhaul for 2015, a mere three years after a complete redesign. Highlights include all-new exterior styling, improved handling and a revised interior with more equipment and better materials...."""
benjaminh,Jul-15,"Car and Driver each year has a famous 10 Best Cars. For 2015, two midsize mid-priced sedans made the list—the Mazda6 and the Honda Accord:

http://www.caranddriver.com/features/the-10best-cars-of-2015-feature"
nocho,Jul-15,"benjaminh said:

Hey, thanks for the info, benjaminh - appreciate it! I guess i'm a bit old-fashioned with my love for Toyota, huh? Actually, a lot of my friends talked about the Accord. Mazda6? Never really payed that much attention to it. Gotta start now! Thanks again, food for thought."
benjaminh,Jul-15,"Sure. The Camry is good, but you might want to do some research and do a few test drives to see if there's anything you like better. Are you buying or leasing? Do you have a rough price target? Any features you're particularly looking for? 4 cylinder or 6? Turbo?

PS By the way, why do you have a pic of Putin as your avatar? Just wondering."
benjaminh,Jul-15,"Most of the people here tend to be fans of ""their"" car. Since I'm a long time Accord owner (my wife drives one too), I'm going to take the liberty of pointing out some small advantages the Accord has over the Camry. They are both good cars, and to most people these aren't big differences, but....

In terms of list prices, the Accord and Camry are virtually the same for the base models. The LX auto Accord has an msrp of 22,905, while the Camry lists for 22,970.

But the Accord has a more advanced engine (VTEC with direct injection) and imho a more advanced transmission. That means the Accord accelerates to 60 a little faster, and is rated by the EPA to get 3 more mpg than the Camry (31 mpg combined for Accord vs. 28 for Camry). That's only going to save you maybe a couple hundred bucks a year in gas, but...every little bit helps.

The Accord has slightly higher crash test ratings than the Camry.

The Accord has standard dual zone climate control, while on the Camry that costs extra. This just lets the person in the passenger seat have a different temp than the driver, in case that's wanted. We use this feature a fair amount.

The Accord has slightly better rear visibility than the Camry. The Camry isn't bad, compared to some cars, but the Accord has slightly thinner rear roof pillars.

The Accord has a slightly larger trunk, 15.8 cubic feet, vs. 15.4 for the Camry.

The Accord comes standard with nice-looking alloy wheels, while I think the base Camry has plastic wheel covers.

The Accord has slightly higher resale value than the Camry.

Most people also think the interior controls of the Accord are a little nicer and slightly higher in quality than a Camry.

But, perhaps balancing some of that out, the Camry tends to cost a little less in the ""real world,"" because Toyota sometimes has bigger rebates and incentives."
nocho,Jul-15,"I'm buying. Got about 30K, was thinking between Camry, Accord (my friends mentioned it a lot), Altima, and even RAV4 (toyota). That climate control you mentioned - I was CRAVING for that, really need that feature. Been driving a pre-owned Camry 2013 for a while. And now, after talking to you, I'm thinking maybe it's time for a change. My muddy owns an Altima - gotta check that out, take it for a spin tomorrow. Thanks again for the useful info. By the way, you ever experienced the Altima?

As for Putin, i just love and respect him a lot - he's an amazing guy. Don't pay attention to what they're saying on American TV. He's a true visionary, a man with a big heart and a bright mind."
benjaminh,Jul-15,"I like the Camry better than the Altima. I've had some Altimas as rental cars and they are ok, but....The CVT on the Altima sometimes has an unpleasant performance and a kind of ""whine."" It has only so-so rear visibility, which is a pet peeve of mine. Like the Camry, however, it often is a ""bargain"" with lots of rebates.

The Altima is not a bad car at all, but to some degree you get what you pay for.

For $30k you should be able to get a really nice car. Discounts are big right now, even on Accords. For instance, here's a loaded Accord EXL V-6 with Navigation that has a list price of $33k, but this dealer in Nashville, Crest Honda, has marked it down almost 4k to 29k:

http://www.cresthonda.com/new/Honda/2015-Honda-Accord-92ea1d6d0a0a00646c10d3e1918ddd6a.htm

Also, consider trying Edmund's Price Promise, which should help you negotiate a price.

And, just my 2 cents, here's the midsize car that I'm considering when I replace my 2008 Accord: The Acura TLX. The base model has a list price of $32k, but in some markets, with a lot of negotiation, it can sometimes be had for c. $29k or so. Here's a video review of it:"
benjaminh,Jul-15,"The other car I'm considering for myself is the 2016 Accord, which has some substantial upgrades over the current model, including a snazzy restyle, integration of Apple CarPlay for iphone or AndroidAuto. This will be on the lots in about a month. Discounts won't be nearly as much for a while, however...."
nocho,Jul-15,"Got me a lot of food for thought, my friend. I was kinda not feeling the Altima too (from a distance - never been inside or behind the wheel before), still gonna test drive it tomorrow though. The Accord seems like the best choice for me right now. Never heard about the Acura - will give it a try. Any info on the 2016 Accord price tag? I couldn't find any with a quick google search. Guess a bit more than 30K, no?"
benjaminh,Jul-15,"When Honda does an upgrade they usually don't raise the list price that much. Competition in the midsize segment is brutal, and so they can't! My guess is that list prices will only go up c. $500 or so. But ""real world"" prices will go up by a maybe a couple of thousand for a month or so. Since dealers are selling out the last of the 2015s, discounts are huge at the moment. You can often get $3000 off the list of a 2015, but you might only be able to get $1000 off of a 2016 in the first month or so.

The list prices for the 2015 Accords go from the LX at c. 22k to all the way up to the top of the line Touring at c. 34.

In other words, you should still be able to get a nicely equipped midlevel 2016 EX Accord for c. 26k or so, which seems well within your budget. You could probably even make it to the EXL. If you wait even a couple of months for them to ramp up production, my guess is that some discounts will be available.

Other cars to consider for midsize include the Kia Optima, the Ford Fusion, and the Hyundai Sonata.

As you can tell, I'm a Honda/Acura guy, but all of the midsize cars are pretty good these days."

suydam,Jul-15,One thing to consider if you like the Camry is that many Camry drivers find the Honda suspension a little stiff for their tastes. If you prefer a more softly sprung car you might like the Camry better. You'll just have to drive them and see which you prefer.
berri,Jul-15,"I think that the Camry, Accord and Mazda 6 are all good cars. But like Suydam indicated, they are different cars geared to different buyer preferences. C&D is more geared to sporty vehicles, so I can see how they left the Camry out. We happen to own a Honda and a Toyota. Like them both, but personally I'll take the Toyota on a long freeway trip, but prefer the Honda around town or in the mountains. My advice, test drive all three of them and rank them, throw out any you don't care for and then consider the preferences versus any sale price and resale value differences. You might also test a Fusion and a Malibu while you're at it. Whatever you do, don't let peer pressure or perceived status dominate your decision. If looks play into your decision process, make sure you check each one out in white. That color tends to divulge styling cues and issues that might affect how you'll like it's looks regardless of color you buy a few years down the road."

You speak the truth, my friend - thanks for the heads up! That's pretty much my thoughts on the matter. As a current owner of a Camry 2013, I'm kinda ""warm"" to the brand, but, after this discussion, I'ma pay extra attention to the Accord.

Mr_Shiftright,Aug-15,"I don't think most drivers are trained to estimate speed and in that particular case, it would be hard for anyone inside the car to do so. If I come at your driver's window in my van at 25 mph, I'm sure it looks to you like 60 mph. Your point of reference is a very narrow window--just this looming van taking up most of your field of view. Not the same as watching, say, a car on your left, passing you or other vehicles---you have many more points of reference.

But all that aside, many people suffer injuries at speeds as low as 25-35 mph, so this guy was still fortunate to have a good safety system that worked."

It still seems like a step down from my parents' 2013 Accord LX in terms of materials, ergonomics, visibility, performance, etc.

The ""SE"" Camry's styling touches seem strange to me. Red stitching on the dashboard? An angry/wide fish-mouth grill that seems inspired by Lexus sports cars? For a Camry?

The interior seems ok, but there is one squeak/rattle and more road noise than our 2013 Accord EXL.

Anyway, it's a good car, and there are bargains to be had on this model. But I'm not really impressed.

https://www.cars.com/articles/2016-honda-accord-explaining-the-trim-levels-1420680996508/

Here's the model I'm thinking about:

The Accord EX ($26,300 with a manual or $27,100 with an automatic) builds off the LX, rather than the Sport, with these features:

Honda's LaneWatch system, which mounts a small camera on the passenger-side mirror and throws the image on the Accord's 7.7-inch upper dashboard screen
A second 7-inch dashboard touch-screen with capacitive controls, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, HD/satellite radio and six speakers (versus four)
Power driver's seat
Fog lights, 17-inch alloys and heated mirrors with integrated turn signals
Rear center air vents
A moonroof and one-touch front windows (versus driver's only on LX/Sport)
Keyless access with push-button start
Remote start on automatic-transmission models
XM/HD stereo with 6 speakers"
berri,Aug-15,How come Lane Watch doesn't also look out the left side? Seems to me that's a tougher effort in rush hour driving.
ral2167,Aug-15,Exactly. Honda needs to just put lights on both morris to indicate blind zone objects. This isn't calculus.
stickguy,Aug-15,"I think the logic is that you are looking to the right already for the passenger side, so your eyes are that way already. On the driver's side, you would be looking the ""wrong"" way (and back and forth)

I agree, the simple lights on the mirrors is a better system. though having the mirror camera is kind of neat, I still want the lights."
benjaminh,Aug-15,"The 2016 Accord Sport has a list price of $24,165 for the 6MT, which is just $300 more than last year's model, and for that there are some significant upgrades from 2015 including:

19"" alloy wheels with 235/40 R19 96V tires
new Sport leatherette/cloth seats with side bolsters
larger 12.5"" front brake pads (compared to 11.5 for EX)
new round ball metal shift knob
exclusive to Sport San Marino Red color (available even with the manual transmission)
reshaped chrome exhaust tips
restyled red instruments for Sport
metal foot pedals

Like other 2016 Accords, the Sport also gets a restyle, plus structural upgrades, LED fogs/running lights/tail lights, and other improvements. Here's a 4-minute video tour of a 2016 Sport 6MT in San Marino Red that someone did during the recent press event. In a couple of months discounts should be readily available, and so I'd say this is a good amount of car for the money. Maybe too much bling for me, but still an appealing package:"

benjaminh,Aug-15,"shabadoo25 said:

Starting about 40 years ago, Honda decided to go with trim levels instead of stand-alone options. This was to simplify manufacturing, increase quality, and control costs. When the Accord was first introduced in 1976, iirc, there were just two trim levels—base and LX. Now, of course, things are a lot more complicated. Still, I think for a Ford Fusion you probably have millions of combinations when you include the options, colors, etc. Even with all the trim levels on today's Accord, there are a fraction of the Fusion's number of combos for the Accord.

In Edmunds True Cost to Own feature, I think over 5 years the Accord costs about $2000 less than a comparable Fusion, because there's less depreciation, there are fewer repairs, and lower maintenance costs.

Part of that, arguably, is because Honda has trim levels instead of stand-alone options. But yes, for some people it's frustrating because you can't get the exact combo you want. But for many people it's worth it."
suydam,Aug-15,Aren't those optional?
stickguy,Aug-15,"Not stand alone options. Need to get a different model, but you lose the sport features.

Gotta pick what you really want!"
benjaminh,Aug-15,"That Accord Sport model is really popular, especially with younger buyers. But I think there's another reason that Honda builds it, and that's this: it's aimed at the editors and writers of Car and Driver. They love the Accord Sport for the manual transmission (one of the last available on a midsize sedan), the handling, the looks, the relatively affordable price, etc.

And the 2016 Sport adds even more pizzazz, and also addresses one of the less strong spots of the Accord—the braking distance. Honda knows C & D is likely to have one of these in their long-term fleet. And by having brake pads a full inch larger than the rest of the line-up, I assume the Sport will have a shorter stopping distance. And those huge tires will probably provide good handling. The new custom Sport seats with bolsters, etc. should go down well too.

I think Honda is trying to do absolutely everything they can to stay on the C & D top 10 list with this model of the 2016 Accord."
robr2,Aug-15,The manual is still available on the LX and EX models as well. I believe the EX is the volume seller.

I have both sets of floor mats, and the cloth ones are barely used. I think $15,500 is a fair price. It has 42k, a new high pressure fuel pump after the recall did not perform favorably to the pump and it popped a big leak.

All service records, no accidents, and the most OCD Meguiar's wax job ever. Anyway, I want to sell it. What do you guys think it is worth."

http://www.caranddriver.com/photo-gallery/2016-kia-optima-photos-and-info-news#1

The only problem I have with the design, is that it's another sedan with rear window design and thick rear pillars that create big blind spots from the driver's seat. Looks good, but for me that would be a ""no sale"" right there. Otherwise, I think KIA quality, performance, and design are quite good now."

Glad I'm not the only one here who thinks the TLX is a nice looking car. But yes, given the thicker rear pillars compared to the Accord I wish it had the blind spot monitoring system on the base model too. And now that Accord has CarPlay/AndroidAudo on EX trims and above, it seems like the TLX should have it too.

http://www.digitaltrends.com/car-reviews/2016-honda-accord-first-drive/

""The 2016 Accord maintains its dominant position as the best midsize sedan.

....The 2016 Accord, unlike the Camry, seems to effortlessly check every relevant box for midsize sedan/coupe shoppers. Pair the four-cylinder with a CVT transmission and it’s wonderfully fuel-efficient. Spring for an EX or above trim level and you’re rewarded with the latest infotainment technology — in this case the smartphone-mimicking Apple CarPlay and Android Auto systems. Get back to basics with a six-speed manual-equipped Accord Sport and there’s a fun yet tame driving experience to be had. Load up a Touring model and travel in blissful quiet and comfort. You get the idea – the 2016 Accord is a shape-shifting vehicle that consumers would be hard-pressed to fault....

As for the Accord’s driving dynamics, it’s clear that even as a coupe, even with the V6, and even with a manual transmission, this is no sports car. But if that piece of information doesn’t bother you, there’s a lot to love about how the 2016 Accord drives. In Sport and Touring trim, the steering responsive is sharp (though not accompanied by much feedback), cornering is flat and fluid, and both the four and six-cylinder engines have plenty of poke.
Inside the cabin, even in the lowest of trims, the 2016 Accord’s layout is smart, the materials feel high-quality, and visibility is excellent. The front seats are comfortable and supportive, the rear seats have plenty of legroom for adults, there’s ample interior storage, and button layout is intuitive. At cruising speeds, there’s very little road noise in the cabin and it feels like both commutes and long trips would be a breeze. The 7.0-inch display is responsive and easy to read, even in direct sunlight. To complement Honda’s brilliant safety technology, Honda expects to receive a five-star safety rating from the NHTSA and a Top Safety Pick Plus designation from the IIHS....

If the crossover craze has yet to take hold of you, the only argument against the 2016 Honda Accord is that it’s acceptably good at everything, and therefore an everyman’s car. If you want to stand out from the crowd and a Marino Red, manual-equipped Accord isn’t distinguished enough for you, then you’re probably in the market for a Mazda6...."

benjaminh,Aug-15,"berri said:

All Accords up to the year 2012 had a lot of road noise. I owned a 2002, and still own a 2008, and unfortunately road noise was/is a weak spot for both of them. Starting in 2013 Accords became a lot quieter, and my wife's 2013 Accord bears that out. For 2016 they've made some slight improvements, but the big change already happened at the start of this generation of Accord.

I think if you haven't yet driven this generation, you'll be pleasantly surprised. That's not to say it's particularly better than the competition (although our 2013 Accord seems quieter than the recent 2015 Camry we had as a rental car), but just that Accord has caught up in this one area where it used to be behind...."

suydam,Aug-15,Next year according to the article. Not a big surprise though.
robr2,Aug-15,"suydam said:

Hyperbolic story is hyperbole.

GM is preparing for negotiations with the UAW. This type of posturing goes on all the time just before negotiations. Read the article closely. The words ""may"" and ""predicts"" are used multiple times in the article. Reuters is merely reporting some rumors without actually doing any research.

Here is a good outline from another forum:

Verano is currently made at Orion Assembly with Sonic. Orion is getting Bolt ""and another vehicle"" next year. So far, people are saying the ""other vehicle"" is Sonic but GM can move Sonic back to Korea pretty easily so the ""other vehicle"" could be Verano. GM didn't say what the ""other vehicle"" is on purpose because of UAW negotiation. Additionally, Sourcing Verano from China is a stretch when Mexico has plenty of room... The new Cruze is moving to Ramos Arizpe but it has plenty of capacity left for fellow D2XX platform next gen Verano (or Envision... see below). And another key UAW moving piece puzzle comes in play here - Lordstown where ""Cruze Limited"" is being made for rental fleets has no other products. One can see that Cruze Limited production level will start to drop once the new Mexican Cruze hit the streets. The UAW would very much like the Verano to go to Lordstown or stay at Orion. GM is saying hey, we can move this to China... is just negotiation subterfuge. GM has three options here: Lordstown with some UAW concession, Stay in Orion, or Ramos Arizpe.

Regal is currently made at Oshawa Canada. Regal sells in such low numbers now that the most logical thing to do is probably to discontinue it altogether. Importing it from Germany makes some sense since the Opel plant is going to be way under utilized. But it's probably cheaper to keep Regal in Oshawa or move it to Fairfax with LaCrosse. So again, pure UAW contract talk posturing.

Encore is staying in Korea for sure. Trax is also coming from Korea so it's completely unreasonable to think that GM will source one from China and the other one from Korea... what would be the point? The logistic costs will overwhelm any potential cost saving. Potential wildcard... Encore and Trax are G2XX platform car like Sonic. And so is the new Bolt... If I was doing production planning at GM, I would want the more profitable CUV G2XX production in the US and the less profitable Sonic to go away. So Encore + Trax + Bolt at Orion makes a lot of sense to me.

Envision is for sure not coming from China. GM can't keep up with demand of it in China so there is zero chance it will ship them to the US. Chevy Equinox and GMC Terrain are currently made in CAMI in Canada. Since they are moving to the D2XX platform with Envision (also Cruze and Verano), you can see how the pieces are starting to fall... Envision + Verano will be a nice get for UAW to land in Lordstown. But GM can build Envision at CAMI or Ramos Arizpe depending on volume. All these D2XX vehicles can be moved around without that much trouble."
ab348,Aug-15,I can't see sourcing from China as any worse than sourcing from Korea.

socal_eric,Aug-15,"benjaminh said:

Little bit late to post, although the implementation is simpler than previous generation Honda rear-wheel steering some might view it as another potential unknown for future reliability.

While the new P-AWS on the TLX does appear affective from some of the positive press, the brake-based torque vectoring and understeer control used in cars like the Focus and Fiesta ST is simpler and can also work extremely well (and other models are coming to market using similar Continental-Teves ABS units). Also for how dowdy some might think the overall package, the current Malibu and cars based on GM's Epsilon/Epsilon II platform have a passive rear-wheel steering designed into the suspension. While Chevrolet didn't market it there's a lot of info if you do a search for Saab's ReAxs on the platform-mate 9-3."
stickguy,Aug-15,"had a nice 1K road trip this weekend in my 2015 Sonata. RT from philly area to NC and back through VA. great road trip car. averaged about 34 MPG overall, in mixed driving (including the scenic back country way home to skip another jaunt on 95 on a Sunday). Best leg was 205 miles from Fredericksburg back to Jersey today. By a miracle, traffic was moving, so was mostly around 70, and between 65-75, with a little local. That stretch was 36 MPG even.

Everything was where it should be and the exterior was very unoffensive. Don't see why GM doesn't sell more of these to be honest. About an hour later, got into a 2015 Cruze LTZ and though I didn't like the power under foot, the interior was o k and the exterior a bit bland. After seeing a pic of the new 2016, it looks much better and hopefully will give Cruze sales a shot in the arm. If I was going this size in a GM model, would definitely prefer the Verano as it seems and feels to be a more upscale vehicle. But when these two are compared to their import counterparts, not sure what I'd do. Price wise, can't beat GM but there's just something about certain imports which more folks prefer for some reason.
But must admit, GM does make some impressive vehicles right now but needs to improve their mpg's for one thing and push the envelope on their exteriors. Once they do these couple of things, think their sales will definitely keep pace with the top models in their segments.

My '14 Malibu LT2 is getting broken in. Drove from Dayton to Cincinnati on interstate at speed limit for a street car show in Newport a couple Sundays back and then to late lunch and on to a weekly cruise in. Total of about 150 miles. I'd guess 10 miles were on city streets before being back on the interstate. The indicated mileage was 38.3 mpg and based on an earlier check driving to Pigeon Forge it should be within 1 mpg. I'd like to see how another midsize would have fared on my same trip. I believe many go by the published miles on other vehicles rather than real world results.

Still looks and drives as new. Good power from the 2.4, CVT ok, great gas mileage, consistently above 30 mpg, have broken 40 mpg on occasion. I do wish the ride was a little less firm, a little less road noise--though much improved from past years, a better sound system (got to have good audio and having been spoiled by the Dynaudio in previous car, I have become even more critical).

It's been a good car, but my wife needed the easier entry/exit of an SUV. Also the buyout is more than current retail value--which was a good deal for us, payment-wise. We put just over 24k miles on it in 34 months, including a 3000-mile cross-country trip.

Overall we were very pleased with the Sonata. Smooth ride, good power, decent handling, comfortable seats (especially the 8-way power driver's seat), handy seat heaters, and very good fuel economy that exceeded the EPA ratings when driven moderately. There were a few recalls for software fixes and the shifter, but nothing that ever took it out of service. Nothing broke--except the front bumper, from several parking-lot incidents, but that wasn't the fault of the car except I wish those front bumpers weren't quite so low to the ground. I'd be tempted to jump for a lease on a 2015 Sonata (I've seen them recently for under $200/month sign-and-drive for 36 months) except for the need for the higher entry/exit.

So now down to just one mid-sizer in the family fleet, the 2008 Mazda6i that my daughter drives to school and work. That car is still going strong at about 110k miles, except I found out it will need a new valve cover gasket soon."
ivan_99,Sep-15,"I'm the proud owner of a 2016 Mazda 6 Touring (6M). I drove the Accord (not the manual), Altima, Sonata Eco, Fusion SE.

I actually liked them all, but fell in love with the Mazda. The Sontata had the 7spd which was real nice, it wasn't as eager as a VW DSG, but I liked it better than the traditional auto. It may not have been a fair comparison as the Mazda was the only manual (which I prefer but am not bound to). They all felt similar in power but the Mazda appeared to have more low-mid than the others (again this could have been the transmission choice). I will not be dropping the clutch at high rpms or tracking it so they all have more than appropriate power for a daily driver (not that I'm opposed to stupid power...I was considering the Challenger/Charger hemi)

The Mazda did not have the types of rebates as the others but I felt the vehicle was a trim level above the others. The Sonata had huge rebates, Ford did as well (with 0% for 72mo) I really liked the Mazda leatherette; I felt it was on par with others leather. The interior actually reminded me of Audi (that I was swayed to previously but wouldn't drop that kind of money now). For me it was the best driving, best interior. They sealed the deal by giving me 1600 off of MSRP (TMV shows only 500) and $3k more than others for my trade in (plus 0.9% was nice...).

Missing...I do like fog lights that were not included (I like extra light at night...) and the home link rear view mirror. I'll be adding these as aftermarket add-ons. It didn't have NAV but I was told it could be added at any point for $400. I can't see doing this as every integrated NAV always paled in comparison to google maps (it would be nice if google maps were added as one of the Mazda Apps). It didn't have a sunroof...which made me real happy since I can't stand them (so this missing was a plus for me)."

We almost bought an Accord but the Mazda6 just drove so much better and the interior was a step up from the Accord.  We actually could have gotten an even better deal on the Accord as they were blowing out the 2015s but just liked the Mazda6 a lot more.  I'm with you on the sunroof, hate them.  I don't miss the fogs in the least either.  Our other two vehicles have them and I never use them.  The Homelink auto dimming mirror may be a Christmas present.  First tank of gas netted 33.2mpg which admittedly is due in part to babying the car for its first 600 miles and is only one tank.  But it's a good sign.
Good luck with your new Mazda6 Touring."

What I prefer with imports over the GM's is not being stranded on the side of the road with a bad alternator, starter, radiator leak, minor and major engine problems like busted timing chains and blown head gaskets. Now, this was a long time ago, but it still leaves an impression. Every time I see a GM that I like, there is this little voice in the back of my head that says ""what are you a glutton for punishment stupid?""

I just need consistent, fantastic reviews and a lot of time before I would ever consider one. On the truck end, I think the Ram continues to look the best...and I don't need a truck to haul 14 transmissions at a time so Aluminum or Steel is moot point, Chevy continues to take pot shots at Ford to reassure owners of it's continued use of ""High strength Steel"" (yes I know this is sedans...but I thought I would throw that in).

P.S. Hi everybody. I have spent the past 10 days moving my mom into a retirement community and moving myself into her home, while a re-hab team works on my old condo to extract max value. The end result is NO MORTGAGE. Kia gave me a payment deferment which really helped out with expenses, including two guys and a van for $200 that did a great job when the rest of us were just knackered. It was 100 F and 120% humidity last week too. Sweet. (Uggghhh)"

Ha Ha, I don't care for sunroofs either, after years of malfunctions, leaks, and other fun things like that. I HAVE to have fog lights, and I actually prefer my cell phone Google maps attached firmly with a Garmin w255 mount. (The Garmin mount fits the Galaxy s2, s3, s4, and s5 like a glove. No wiggling or bouncing up and down on the windshield)

Also, I drove the Mazda 6 twice, and I also noticed mid range punch was better than on my car and the Accord. Funny thing though, over 4200 RPM my Optima's 25 HP and just a bit more torque advantage kicks in. However, the Mazda's power is more usable at legal speeds....and mid speed fun is the only fun you will have around DC. There really is no ""out on the open road"" around here. We are lucky if the road is just ""open""."

My mileage has been amazing down particular roads. I'm just using the instant MPG setting (so I'm not certain if it's scientific or more of a novelty). There is a stretch of road I routinely take to pick up my kids and have consistently achieved 50-60mpg. It's a stead 50mph in 6th gear.

benjaminh,Sep-15,"The way the EPA measures it, the 2016 Civic coming out in a few months will actually be classified as a ""midsize car."" Here's the math. The EPA says that if you combine the interior volume of a car with the trunk volume, a car needs to be at at least 110 cubic feet to be Midsize. The top of the midsize range is 119 cubic feet, and I think the Sonata goes just past that and all the way into full size territory.

Anyway, the current Civic LX has an interior volume of c. 94 and a trunk that's 12.5 cubic feet.

The 2016 Civic LX will, it seems, have an interior volume of c. 98 and a trunk that's 15 cubic feet, leading to a total volume of c. 113. Even the 2016 EX Civic, with the moonroof, will apparently have inside room of c. 96 cubic feet, and since the trunk is the same, it'll be around 111.

I don't think Honda's going to advertise is as a midsize car, but that seems to be what it is.

It's also going to have highway mpg of c. 42 mpg with the newly available 1.5 turbo, which is tops for the class, and acceleration with the turbo that is also going to be class leading, and might even break 7 seconds, which would be significantly faster than a 4-cylinder Accord with the auto.

The 1.5T is said to make c. 174 hp.

The only downside to the car I can see is that the rear visibility for the driver doesn't look very good. But the styling is pretty sporty for a Civic."
benjaminh,Sep-15,rear view of the 2016 Civic....
brian125,Sep-15,"The Elantra followed by the Sentra is the biggest small car depending on the new 2016 Civic numbers. I have not seen them yet.

Rear hip .................................52.7......................................51.4

Sentra's cargo is listed at............. @15.1cu ft . EPA interior @111.0


This redesign model should put Honda up in sales this coming year. Rear and side visibility looks terrible on this Civic model.. The Corolla and Sentra would seem more attractive to that buyer."
benjaminh,Sep-15,"Power to weight ratio....

2016 Civic EX-T will weigh c. 2900 lbs/174 horses with the turbo =16.7 pounds of car per horse

2016 Accord EX weighs 3336 / 185 horses = 18.0 pounds per horse

The low-end torque on the turbo is going to be impressive when you floor it. You're not going to build power slowly as revs build, like a traditional V-Tech. With the Civic turbo you're going to go like a bat out of hell after the first fraction of a second.

In other words, it seems likely to me that the 2016 Civic Turbo will be a bit faster than the Accord 4 CVT.

PS Agree with you Brian that rear visibility looks poor. What a pity....Wish they'd made it look like a BMW 3 series instead...."
m6user,Sep-15,"It's a good thing that hardly anyone considers the EPA as the designator of car class.  I appreciate they give you a comparison number but a Civic is just a compact car with a lot  room like the Sentra.  I think even the subcompact Versa has a lot of room the way the EPA measures it.  
Putting a tall roof on a car increases interior volume but unless your an NBA player it's not a big deal and doesn't add much useful space.  I find it hard to believe the new Civic will have a 15 CU ft trunk and haven't seen that in any of the product announcements.  Nor have I seen HP mentioned anywhere.  Where did you find those numbers?"

http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2015-volkswagen-golf-18t-tsi-automatic-test-review

""Acceleration times for this fully loaded 3135-pound Golf were unimpressive at 7.7 seconds to 60 mph and 15.9 in the quarter-mile.""

As a hatchback, however, the Golf is a champ when it comes to total room. With room behind the backseat at an impressive 22.8 cu ft., and passenger room at 93.5, it gets a total of 116, making it a midsize car by the epa classification.

In terms of mpg the Golf 1.8T would have been impressive even a few years ago, but now the highway rating of 37 is just average. The Accord is also rated at 37 on the highway now, and the Mazda6, the current leader, is rated at 38. The new Civic Turbo is expected to get an epa rating of c. 42 mpg hwy."

benjaminh,Sep-15,"Car and Driver is a good source.

There are other sources that are good too. What's yours? Please post...

In any case, I'm just guessing that the 2016 Civic turbo will be faster, mainly because of its lower weight. But we'll see in a month or so.

The Focus ST has a 2.0 Turbo, the new Civic Si will also have a 2.0 turbo, but won't be out for several months....."
brian125,Sep-15,"Here is Edmunds take on the 16 Focus St model

Powertrains and Performance

Under the hood, the front-wheel-drive 2016 Ford Focus ST gets a turbocharged 2.0-liter inline four-cylinder engine that delivers 252 hp and 270 pound-feet of torque. It's mated to a six-speed manual transmission that includes hill-start assist.

In Edmunds testing, the Ford Focus ST accelerated from zero to 60 in 6.4 seconds, which is a bit sluggish for this type of performance car. That's partly explained, however, by the fact that you have to shift into 3rd gear to hit 60, which puts a little extra time on the clock; most rivals with manual transmissions can get there in 2nd gear.

The EPA estimates that the Focus ST will achieve 26 mpg combined (23 city/32 highway), a respectable showing for a hot hatch."

Same as you, just the next review down the list with a manual transmission.

My good friend Scott bought a 2015 Si with the 205 HP 2.4 liter and a 6 speed manual with at first hard, but then amazingly comfortable seats and a nice office. There were a few ergonomic anomalies, but I quickly learned them. The main thing...the engine...was phenomenal. He let me wind it out, and there was none of the unpleasant sounds mine makes as it reaches redline. I think next time I would like a Japanese car, not a Korean knockoff. I just love the fluidic feel of the Honda engines. They are just a cut above. My only caveat is why Honda does not offer a longer standard warranty???

My high-pressure fuel pump died right after I got a recall notice (which I immediately had done) to have it's pressure lowered as apparently it was a frequently replaced item under warranty. Now, this did not leave me stranded, as the low pressure pump got me through the rest of my day AND over to the dealer w/o the indignity of a tow.
I can't help wondering that if it was a Honda engine it might have been better engineered, and the DI pump may never failed in the first place. Unfortunately, I am too old for a boy-racer Civic, and since I just moved and had to replace all my flat screen TV's the movers broke, the only vehicle I am in the market for is my own vehicle's status to change to ""paid for"". One more year. 13 payments and I am DONE. Other than the pump, no other problem has presented itself on my '12 Optima EX base."

KIA's are well-engineered cars, and Honda has had its own problems in the past with transmissions, etc. It's great you were covered.

Congrats on getting down to just one year of payments on your Optima.++

My 2008 Accord has long been paid for, but we still have 2.5 years of payments left on my wife's 2013 Accord. My car isn't quite to the point of putting a sticker on it saying, ""Don't laugh—it's paid for,"" but it's true that I'm slowly getting ready for something new. But honestly there's nothing wrong with my Accord. Everything works.

As to your question of why Honda doesn't have the length of warranty of a KIA/Hyundai, well, as you know, nobody else has that kind of warranty! Hats off to KIA for doing that, but no one else is going to give that kind of coverage away for free.

I have wondered now that Honda is about to introduce turbos if they might lengthen their engine warranty, but it seems like that's not going to happen. Seems like it's going to stay at 5 years and 60,000 miles. That's still a lot longer than the warranties offered back until the early 1980s, which were 12 months and 12,000 miles.

I think it was Chrysler that started lengthening the warranties back in c. 1981? Wasn't that when Lee Iacocca introduced the ""7/70 Protection Plan""?"

Back in 2008, I was pleased that my new Accord was rated 31 on the highway, which seemed good, and was class-competitive at the time. Real world mpg is about the same as the EPA ratings.

In 2013, my wife's new Accord CVT was rated 36 on the highway, and we've often exceeded even that.

And now this year, some midsize cars are going even higher. The refreshed 2016 Accord is now rated 37 on the highway, which was just topped by the refreshed 2016 Passat, now rated 38, and all of them have now been exceeded by the refreshed 2016 Altima, which has a 39 mpg hwy rating.

Though Honda doesn't offer the 5/60,10/100 that Hyundai/Kia does, my experience has been very positive. Last week the check engine light displayed on our Pilot. It is out of warranty, 5 years old and 78000 miles. Honda had a TSB and replaced 4 sparkplugs as the VCM system caused a mis-fire situation. No charge for the repair. ( I had the other 2 spark plugs replaced on my dime for good measure). We have also received an extended warranty on the liquid filled bushings on the Pilot to 120000 miles. On our CRV, we received an extension on the AC compressor. I know Honda had issues in the past with their 5 speed auto. We had an 03 Odyssey that was affected and an additional cooling line was installed. My point is that Honda has shown good will to stand behind their product.

""Honda, Grappling With Quality Problems, Will Replace Its President
By JONATHAN SOBLEFEB. 23, 2015

TOKYO — Honda Motor said on Monday that it would replace its president and chief executive, Takanobu Ito, a sign the Japanese automaker may be trying to draw a line under recent quality problems.

Honda has grappled with a series of safety issues and development delays. Although the origins of some of the problems — notably faulty airbags made by the Japanese supplier Takata — predate Mr. Ito’s tenure, other complications have been easier to attribute to him and his management team.

Last year, in response to an embarrassing string of events, Mr. Ito appointed a senior managing officer to oversee quality...."""

I think Edmunds provides a more realistic, and less damaging approach to 0 to 60 times. The ""Big Three"" car mags use agressive 0 to 60 techniques that 95% of us would never do to our own cars. Like 5k rpm clutch dumps, multiple times. It also has to be an average of two runs. one down a runway, one back to cancel out any wind advantage one direction could provide.

I think friendly, infrequent, high speed ""racing"" is a lot more fun than stoplight to stop light. I enjoy 85 to 100+ mph speeds and how it feels to pilot a vehicle at that level, w/o all the wear and tear of burnouts and violent tranny shifts that can bust a half shaft, or more seriously the tranny itself.

Your figure for the Malibu 2014/15 is wrong. It's 25/29/36. So the 27 should be a 29.

I have a Malibu and it just gave 38.3 on a 160 mile trip on I75 to Cincinnati to 2 car shows on recent Sunday with about 10 miles of city driving to park, get somewhere to eat, and then to the late Sunday weekly cruise in. That's at the speed limit all the way to near downtown and AC running to have a happy wife. LOL.
My total mileage over local and mixed driving and all is 32.7 right now, which lends credulity to the 29 for mixed driving estimate by the EPA.

With 195 HP and 191 lb-ft torque, it's a very nice car to drive and has a road feel that must be from its German roots from the original chassis designed for and used by several GM models in Europe. Has a tight but well-controlled ride without being brutal and never loses its composure on any road surface."

But my Honda's have been pretty good as far as repairs go, albeit not quite as reliable as my overall Toyota experiences. I've owned several of both brands over the past decade."

It does. From what I read in the owner's manual is that you can still start the car if the battery in the fob is weak by holding the fob close to the Start button. I think on my next service I will replace the fob battery as a measure of preventive maintenance. One thing I do know, is that the keyless entry/start/stop spoiled me quickly.

benjaminh,Oct-15,"It's interesting how the Civic has grown, esp. for 2016. Compared to the 2015 Civic, the 2016 Civic is two inches wider, and maybe two inches longer. 20 years ago, in 1996, we were in the third year of the 5th generation of the Honda Accord, and the new Civic is similar in size to that Accord. It's also similar in size to the current BMW 320i. Comparing a Civic to a BMW 320i in some ways is silly, since they are completely different classes of car, but this is the first Civic for which it might make even a tiny bit of sense. The upper trims of the new Civic get Honda's new 1.5 liter turbo engine, which makes 174 horsepower, which is not that far from the 180 horsepower from the 2.0 liter turbo in the 320i. But the Civic is going to weigh c. 350 pounds less than the 320i, and so there's the possibility that acceleration could be similar. Motor Trend tested the 320i at 6.7 seconds 0-60. I'm sure the Civic turbo 1.5 will be slower than that, but maybe close to 7 seconds? And Honda has also said that handling for the new Civic is more sporty. Anyway, here are some dimensions for comparison.

2016 Civic 1996 Accord 2016 320i

length c.181 inches 184 182

width c.71 inches 70 71

hp (w/turbo) 174 130 180

I know, of course, that the real competitors for the 2016 Civic are the 2016 Corolla, the 2016 Sentra, the 2016 Focus, etc. But now it is potentially for those who want a car that's roomy, but a bit smaller than the current Accord."
akirby,Oct-15,"I don't think there is any ""prestige"" associated with a Civic (or most any other mainstream sub $30K vehicle) to begin with so lower trim lines won't hurt.

Ford has shown that people are willing to pay more for loaded models from the Focus and Fusion Titaniums all the way to $65K F150 platinums and Limiteds. Which is why Fusion ATPs are $4k higher than Camry."
suydam,Oct-15,"Well, depends on how you define prestige. Back when we were younger and barely had two nickels to rub together, we could only dream of owning a Civic. We bought a Mazda 323 ( which turned out to be a great car) because we couldn't manage the extra $2k for the Civic."
benjaminh,Oct-15,"suydam said:

Back in 1988, when I was helping my sister buy her first car, we made the exact same decision. She wanted a Civic, but it was almost 2k more. And so she went with the Mazda 323 instead, which was really a great little car.

Today, as in the past, there's a bit of a premium to own a Honda. But the market is so competitive that the premium is small now, and sometimes nothing at all. For instance, at a dealer in Nashville all 2015 Civic LX autos, which have a list of c. $20k, are going for $16.5. That 3,500 off of list is probably as much of a discount as you'll find on a Focus or anything else in the class.

But Honda is clearly trying to move the 2016 Civic back to best-in-class in almost all areas, including power, room, mpg, safety, features, style, etc. The list prices, I hope, will only be modestly higher, but for 6 months, and maybe a year, I'm sure Honda is hoping that discounts will be much more modest."
benjaminh,Oct-15,"Currently the Ford Focus Titanium tops out at about $28k msrp. My guess is that the top-of-the-line 2016 Civc, the Touring, will be a little higher, but will have more power, more room, and have some features that the Focus Titanium lacks. But I'd guess close to a $28k msrp for the 2016 Civic Touring as well, but with much smaller discounts than you'd get on a Ford. We'll find out prices in about 10 days, but here are my guesses right now for msrps before destination:

LX 6MT c. $19k

EX-T CVT c. 23k
EX-L CVT c. 24.5k
EV-L Navi with Sensing c. 26k

benjaminh,Oct-15,"As we've all heard, by 2025 federal laws for Corporate Average Fuel Economy set a goal of 54 mpg. That number, however, is a mirage or bogeyman, depending on how you look at it, because it's based on the EPA mpg tests from 1975. The actual EPA window sticker we have now, which has been reduced twice in the last several decades to more closely track real-world results, is about 30% lower. In other words, multiply 54 x .7 and you get about 38 mpg combined mpg on the sticker. Here's a guide from Edmunds on the 1975 EPA numbers for each class of vehicle for CAFE over the years, past and future:

http://www.edmunds.com/fuel-economy/good-and-bad-news-emerges-from-cafes-fine-print.html

For midsize cars the CAFE standards move forward like this:

2012: 32 mpg (actually only about 22 combined mpg on the window sticker)

2017: 38 mpg (27 combined mpg on the sticker)

2021: 45 mpg (32 on the sticker)

2025: 54 mpg (38 on the sticker)

Several midsize cars are currently rated 30 or 31, and so far exceed the standard for 2017, and get close to meeting the standard for 2021. The 2016 Honda Accord is rated at 31. An all new Accord is due for the 2018 model year, and we can guess that it'll get at least a couple of mpg higher than the current model, and the 33 mpg it will likely get should let it meet the standard all the way to 2022, when the next all-new Accord is due.

In general I support the CAFE standards, and they are one reason among many that fuel prices have come down recently by lowering demand slightly, but I still don't see right now how a midsize car gets to 38 by 2025. I think, however, there are ways to carry forward credits, and get credits for other things, and so the actual number might be closer to 36. But still that seems ambitious given that the 2015 Civic is rated at 33 mpg combined.

But the 2016 Civic, which as mentioned now moves up to EPA's midsize, is expected to get c. 42 mpg on the highway and maybe c. 31 in the city, for a combined rating of c. 35. That's pretty close to the 2025 standard of 36 with credits, and we're still 9 years away from it."
benjaminh,Oct-15,"As a PS from that article from Edmunds above:

""The 54.5-mpg figure equals about 36 mpg in the EPA's current window-sticker measuring system.""

And so the next time you hear someone say that those crazy gov't rules are requiring 54.5 mpg, you can tell someone that the actual number on the EPA sticker of the car, which is pretty close to real world mpg now, will be about 36.

Just doesn't make much of a headline to scream: ""Cars that get 36 mpg by 2025."" But actually that is still a significant improvement from where we are now."

Ding ding ding! We have a winner! 2001 Elantra. Hyundai marketed the heck out of the mid-sized interior numbers... that, and the warranty. Then in 2005 they did the same trick on the 2006 Sonata, which was marketed as having a full-sized interior. But then this upsizing became pretty commonplace, so that today's ""compacts"" are like yesterday's mid-sized carrs, and today's subcompacts like my Rio are like compacts of the past.

In most of the world, the mid-sized sedans so popular here would be considered humongous cars.

The Accord is at the large end of EPA's midsize category, just a foot or so away from full size, while the Civic is just barely in the midsize realm, and will still be considered by most a compact.

But now that the Civic has abandoned the smaller car area, Honda does need a new small sedan to take the place of where the Civic used to be in the 1980s-early 2000s. In other markets Honda has a ""City"" sedan that is about the size of a Civic from 20 years ago. It's based on the Fit platform, and perhaps they'll bring it here at some point."

The new naturally-aspirated engine for the 2016 Civic is a 2.0, which makes about 15 more hp than the old 1.8. The new 1.5 turbo makes 174 horsepower.

That 42 mpg hwy figure is from the Orange County, Calif, auto show, plastered on a big billboard behind a Touring model, which does have the turbo:

http://www.civicx.com/threads/42-mpg-highway-being-displayed-for-2016-civic-1-5t-touring.399/

Maybe both the 2.0 and the 1.5T get 42 on the hwy? In any case, we'll find out on Monday, when the press embargo ends, and Honda puts out its press releases, and every car magazine will have stories on the 2016 Civic out.

As you say, it's a question for the turbo whether 42 can be achieved in the real world. As we know, most car magazines have had trouble hitting the EPA numbers with vehicles with Ford's Ecoboost engines. Consumer Reports went so far as to call the engines ""Ecoboast,"" because the mpg was such a letdown. And I don't think Ford is alone in this. I think if you have a very light foot most turbos can maybe get close to their epa mpg numbers....But who wants to always use a light foot when you have a turbo?

When I get off work, I have an uphill ramp to the freeway, and no merge lane. I've had to floor it in every recent car I've owned to get up to speed for that. I assume if I had a turbo Civic the same might be true? Difficult to say....

Anyway, Honda might have the same problem as other turbos with hitting their EPA numbers with their 1.5T....

99% of the time, I am in my car by myself. We have an Outback for family duty. So, I don't need a mid-sized car. I currently drive an Elantra GT.

However, I also lease to keep the payments budget friendly. And, the best lease deals are found on cars in the mid-sized sedan category - Camry, Accord, Mazda 6, Ford Fusion, etc.

So, when my current lease is up in 12 months, I'll be looking at those cars closely to see which one has the best discount from sticker and the best lease numbers.

I'll look at compacts - the new Civic is pretty intriguing, but I wonder how lease friendly it will be in a year.

So many choices, and really, not a bad car out there."

""....Creeping up on mid-sizers

The auto industry calls it bracket creep. We call it astonishing, when a 1980s Civic sits next to a 2016 Civic and they pretend to be relatives. The new Civic is big, so big it's not just a Focus/Mazda 3 rival--it's sized very close to other tweeners like the VW Jetta, Dodge Dart and Chrysler 200.

Honda says that's no bad thing--in fact, with a lot of high-strength steel in its body, the new Civic is down nearly 70 pounds over the previous model, even while it's grown in almost every direction. It's grown 2.9 inches overall in length, to 182.3 inches long. It's 1.9 inches wider, at 70.8 inches, but lower by 0.8 inches, at 55.7 inches tall. The proportions have changed within that bigger envelope, too--hood and cowl height have dropped 1.6 inches, front overhang is down 1.2 inches, the trunk is 3 inches longer, and trunk space is up to 15.1 cubic feet from 12.3.

All told, the Civic wraps up 112.9 cubic feet of space in its bod, putting it within a few cubes of the Chrysler 200 at 117.4 cubes, and well over the usual EPA yardsticks for mid-size cars. A Mazda 3 falls just shy of that marker at about 108 cubic feet of interior volume.

Those numbers might glaze your eyes over on a spec sheet, but inside the Civic they pay very big dividends....""

""2016 Honda Civic 2.0L Sedan
Linear power and an available six-speed stick give the base model its own appeal.

Oct 2015 By STEVE SILER Photography By STEVE SILER

....The all-new 2.0-liter engine is offered only in the entry-level LX model and in the one-rung-up EX. It is said by Honda to both weigh less and have reduced internal friction compared with last year’s 1.8-liter, while kicking out an additional 15 horsepower and 9 lb-ft of torque. The totals are now 158 horsepower at 6500 rpm and 138 lb-ft at 4200 rpm. In true Honda i-VTEC fashion, power builds in a linear crescendo, with no lumpiness or lag. Just as sweet is the 2.0-liter’s rorty Honda sound—that’s pure sound, without synthesizing or amplification—which permeates the Civic’s well-insulated cabin with every full-tilt run up to the engine’s 6700-rpm redline.

....The cabin environs seem simultaneously more modern and more intimate, thanks to the wide dashboard design, one-inch-lower front hip point, and taller two-tiered center console that cossets the front passengers. An old Honda trait has returned in the form of the remarkably low windshield cowl, which has dropped 1.6 inches and allows an expansive view of the road ahead.

....even at the LX level, the Civic is no stripper, with its standard digital speedometer, automatic climate control, comfortable cloth seats, electronic parking brake, automatic headlamps, and more."""
m6user,Oct-15,"I know it's hard to be open minded when you are infactuated with one brand but there are many cars that everyone considers to be compacts that the EPA considers midsize.  These include the Corolla, Forte, Elantra, Sentra, Dart, Cruze and others.  If you cared to check I'm pretty sure many of them have lower starting MSRPs than the Civic.  
There are also some cars that most consider midsize or even fullsize that EPA considers compact such as TLX, CC, S60, Benley, M550, BMW640.  Most look at the exterior dimensions of a car as well as interior room when considering a car class.  EPA is just looking at interior which is a combo of seating space and trunk space.  A big trunk or a high roofline can impact that number greatly so you have to dig into the numbers to really compare.  I use cars.com comparison tool to get a comprehensive picture.  I never have used EPA."
m6user,Oct-15,"Disclaimer, I have a RDX and love it so I'm not a Honda basher by any means.  But I do find it boring when a person pushes a brand to the point where one has to wonder what the motivation is.  I also have a Mazda and a Tundra and love them too"
stickguy,Oct-15,"ah, headroom. that is my gripe with the measurements. Basically that it is ""wasted"" space largely. so taking a car and moving it from midsize to compact say just because they added a moonroof makes no sense to me. especially if there is still head clearance. having 2"" instead of 4"" does not IMO chance the roominess or size class of the car. Legroom and hiproom, now that is what counts!"

Hey, you're right. I stand corrected and apologize. Didn't know that some other ""compact"" cars are also now ""midsize"" by the EPA measure. And, as you say, some of them cost less than the new Civic, so I'm doubly corrected. I've had some bad experiences with some brands, like Ford, VW, and GM. But I do like other brands like Mazda, which I've also owned. And speaking of genuine midsize cars, the Mazda6 has been rated higher than the Honda Accord in every comparison test that I've read. And if every magazine says that the 6 handles better than the Accord, I believe that it's true....I've owned three Mazdas going back to the 1980s, and every one of them has been more fun to drive than the three Hondas I've owned."

berri,Oct-15,"Well, I won't call you lightweight - just kidding. I think the answer to sunroofs is to make them optional so either side of the preference is happy. Personally, sunroofs don't do too much for me either way. It's just that some companies, particularly Toyota, are very tight in headroom on many models which means a tall guy either has to settle for driving it like a banger with the seat reclined way back, or move on to something else. Just seems dumb that a manufacturer in that position would force sunroofs on everyone. But I guess Toyota and other manufacturers aren't really hurting for business right now."
roadburner,Oct-15,"berri said:

I checked out a 2015 1LE with a sunroof- and headroom was pretty tight; I'm 5'9"" and I don't think that I could have worn a helmet in the car. That and the overall size pretty much killed my interest in that particular car."
berri,Oct-15,"The big Avalon is as bad, if not worse, than the Camry that way. Actually, that's why we ended up switching to a Honda the last time we bought a car. They are generally roomier for tall guys. We didn't want a lower optioned Toyota LE, but the XLE models all had sunroofs and lacked headspace. The Honda sunroof has not been a problem, but as I said, for us we don't care one way or another about sunroofs, just comfortable driving positions. Having said all that, the Toyota and Honda have both been very reliable vehicles. If the upcoming 16 Malibu is reliable over the next couple of years, might try one of those next, although I'm hearing you may get stuck with a turbo and stop/start which are deal breakers for me right now."

Sandman6472,Oct-15,"I personally like a sun/moon roof and while we both have them now, only I use mine when the weather gets nicer down here, starting next week through mid April. South Florida gets pretty hot those other months so a/c is a must have but soon, I'll be able to open up my roof...yay! Had an aftermarket one done in my old '70 Datsun 210 and what a nightmare that was! Since then, never looked for a vehicle with one but seems VW/Audi include them in most of their vehicles and since we both made the switch, I was a happy camper. Not sure I'd like a drop top to be honest though I almost bought a 2001 BMW 325ic a few years back. Think if I could've got my first choice color and it drove a bit better, I'd have one now plus my '06 Honda Civic. The plan was to have both and switch off depending on the weather or where I was going but things just didn't quite work out on this plan though looking back, I should've pushed a bit harder for it!! In high school down here, we had a 1070 Caddy convertible and I would put the top down whenever I drove the thing...now that was a classy looking vehicle in the light blue with a white top. My dad and his three friends got a great deal on these vehicles from a dealer in Orlando and they drove three down to the country club for them. The folks liked the blue/white top the best and the deal was done.

My another big beef is that with my Limited trim Hyundai Elantra, I was forced to accept the 17 inch wheels with small profile tires.

nyccarguy,Oct-15,"Another sub-par tank fuel economy wise for my 2015 Subaru Legacy 2.5i. Last weekend I took the Legacy on it's first trip. Normally it is my daily driver on my 62 mile per day, 6 day a week, round trip commute from my home in Connecticut to my job in The Bronx, NY. I've been averaging 26.1 mpg per tank for the last 13 months and 20K miles. Last weekend's trip was for my 9 year old son's 1st hockey tournament in Marlborough, MA which is approximately 150 miles from my home in Stamford, CT. We stayed in a hotel that was about 4 miles away from the ice rink, making a few round trips, mostly with the car ""cold."" When the tournament ended, we drove into Boston, parked in a lot not too far off of the highway, and then left later Saturday afternoon. The drive from Boston back home was about 180 miles.

I was confident this was going to be my 1st tank breaking the 30 mpg barrier. Now that gas is cheap (I paid $2.10/gallon) this means nothing, but still. On the way up, I watched as my average mpg gauge (which reads about 2 mpg high) climb up and plateau at 34 - 35 mpg. I was optimistic. 478.6 Miles. 75% highway driving. 16.748 gallons. 28.6 mpg for the trip. Not even my best tank. This car is far from a performance car (I think 0-60 is in the 9 second range). It is however spacious, comfortable, & the AWD is amazing. For the performance I get from a 174 horsepower boxer 4 coupled to a CVT I just expect better fuel economy."

CVT are a compromised disposable solution picked up from the the ATVs and the Snowmobiles where smaller engines and shorter distances are the norm. These belt driven ""rubber band "" and pulley systems are not made to last and no one knows their longetivity yet except some Nissan cars which were shoddy and troublesome when first introduced. Once broken, the CVT tranny need to be replaced at exorbitant cost or people just sell the cars before the [non-permissible content removed] hits the fan and the next sucker who buys the used CVT will be left holding the baby.

My experience with my Accord mirrors yours. I have found getting 36-37 mpg fairly easy to attain with a/c on driving between 65-75 mph. About 6 weeks ago I drove to Pittsburgh and back. This included a lot of city driving and being caught in traffic that was at a virtual standstill for 3 hours due to an accident. For the trip I still averaged 35.7 mpg. The CVT was a pleasure driving up and down the grades in the mountains in VA on I-77, no bothersome downshifting and upshifting, just effortless driving. My only concern is long term reliability of the CVT. It has been fine so far and just turned 50000 mi.

CVT like any typical disposable engineering, is cheap to mass produced and a killer to rebuild.

People who buy CVT would be better off trading it in before they hit 50-80k miles or they will have to have tranny replaced costing at least $ 4k. Nissan had to extend their warranty when they first came out. Now they don't so hard luck to Nissan buyers"

If it blows out of the warranty period and is expensive to fix, then I just won't buy another Subaru.

carboy21 said:

If anything, there's a good chance the roof structure is stronger on cars with a sunroof. If you look at most newer cars the roof strength is a primary function of the pillars and side structure of the car. Beyond the windshield header there isn't much structure side-to-side connecting the outer cage structure of the unibody.

Many don't realize that although brittle, glass is inherently very strong and items like the windshield play a key part in the structural integrity of a vehicle (which is why installation procedures of replacement glass is very important). The glass of a moon/sunroof that sits in rails to allow it to open/move isn't tied directly into the car's structure like a windshield but the automaker normally has to strengthen the roof structure to support the sunroof's frame assembly. That might very well increase the crush and deformation resistance for offset/side/lateral impacts to the upper greenhouse of the vehicle.

While the glass itself might fracture and not be as effective at keeping an unrestrained occupant inside the vehicle in a rollover type collision, the thin steel sheet metal panel of a conventional roof doesn't really have much impact on overall strength of the unibody. If you ever get a chance to walk through a self-serve junkyard and look at various cars that have the headliner remove you'll see most only have a very small brace to help hold up the sheet metal roof panel."
m6user,Oct-15,"Why is this a debate on the pros and cons of moonroofs?  Who cares, it's just personal preference.  I just want to be able to get the high end bells and whistles without having to get a sunroof.
The 19"" wheels on our new Mazda6 Touring look nice but I too wish we could have gotten 17"" or maybe 18"".  It's going to be an extra $250-$350 come new tires time.

m6user,Oct-15,That's why I just use the EPA mpg numbers for comparison rather than what people report. Way to many variables.  Don't know too many people that drive 5-10 mph under the speed limit and I certainly never do.  Nor do i keep it under 2000 rpm.  That's why when reporting mpg that is way more than EPA the extreme methods to get there is the honest way to go.  I don't doubt you got 42 on that highway trip driving like that.
nyccarguy,Oct-15,"Subaru gave the choice of an optional moonroof on both my 2.5i Premium (heated cloth seats, 17"" wheels) & the 2.5i Limited (Leather, 18"" wheels).  The Legacy I test drove was a limited and I was surprised it had leather & no moonroof.  The Legacy is the 1st car I've had in a while that doesn't have a moonroof.  I happen to like the clean, ""slick top"" look.  I also like the way the larger 18"" wheels look on the Limited model.  

You in can't generalize about low profile tires either.  Yes historically they provide a harsher ride, but the manufacturers do a good job at engineering the car to ride well even on low profile tires.  They know the majority of Americans prefer a smooth ride.

Tires make a world of difference.  Before my legacy I had a 2011 BMW 328xi with Continental 45 series, low profile , run flat tires.  After about 20K miles the car started riding rough, crashing over expansion joints, and forget about pot holes.  I got a flat on the way home one night.  Checked out replacement costs on tire rack (for 2).  For a little bit more money, I was able to buy a set of 4 Michelin MXM ZP (zero pressure).  Same size.  Not only did they ride smoother, but the car handled better, felt more planted, and gripped better in the snow."

Run flat ties are a big no no. They are harder and harsher and cannot be repaired if punctured and you cannot get them when you have had a puncture and driven the permissible 50 miles

Some brands like Michelin have higher sulphur content to make them last longer but they have harsher ride.

Others have softer compound and ride softer but last less. To each its own ."

Everyone should just get a minivan. Perfectly functional and nobody needs anything else. [/joking-sarcasm]
show previous quotesIf anything, there's a good chance the roof structure is stronger on cars with a sunroof. If you look at most newer cars the roof strength is a primary function of the pillars and side structure of the car. Beyond the windshield header there isn't much structure side-to-side connecting the outer cage structure of the unibody.Many don't realize that although brittle, glass is inherently very strong and items like the windshield play a key part in the structural integrity of a vehicle (which is why installation procedures of replacement glass is very important). The glass of a moon/sunroof that sits in rails to allow it to open/move isn't tied directly into the car's structure like a windshield but the automaker normally has to strengthen the roof structure to support the sunroof's frame assembly. That might very well increase the crush and deformation resistance for offset/side/lateral impacts to the upper greenhouse of the vehicle.While the glass itself might fracture and not be as effective at keeping an unrestrained occupant inside the vehicle in a rollover type collision, the thin steel sheet metal panel of a conventional roof doesn't really have much impact on overall strength of the unibody. If you ever get a chance to walk through a self-serve junkyard and look at various cars that have the headliner remove you'll see most only have a very small brace to help hold up the sheet metal roof panel.

Michaell,Oct-15,"Our 2015 Outback has a CVT with the 3.6L H6 engine - the software has been set up so that it 'feels' like a traditional automatic transmission, and it also has paddle shifters to manually control what ""gear"" it's in.

The only time I notice it's a CVT is when we are on the highway with the cruise control set and we go up an incline. Rather than drop down a gear or two to hold the speed, the revs simply increase. Very smooth."

Most people shoot off from red light to red light with their foot pressing the accelerator continously to speed up the car. I just keep the foot steady and let the car's gears do the acceleration. Simple but effective technique to avoid guzzling gas at each stop signs . Same thing while approaching stop lights. Anticipate stops and lift of the gas pedal and let the car's gears do the breaking instead rushing to the red light and braking hard.

On highway and interstate driving, always try to set the cruise control at the the speed limit and if a gap opens up or narrows between you and the car in front, use the acce + and decce - buttons to increase or decrease speeds instead of the brake and the gas pedals. Avoid the temptation to close all gaps between you and the cars in front as long as you are doing your steady speed on cruise. Impatient and aggressive driving consumes more gas

And we have people whining about poor gas mileage without evaluating their driving habits"

It is a disposable transmission and these CVT cars will have steep drop in resale values , as CVT has a much shorter lifespan and need to be replaced if blown out, costing 4-5 k .

It is the nature of the CVT , they were meant for smaller engines and shorter distances like Snowmobiles , ATVs and Scooters, Toyota had to face the full federal investigations on much fewer number of unintended acceleration cases then the number of failed tranny, but since this involves getting  higher mpg , human lives are expendable"

a few other benefits are being integrated into the car. Mutes the radio when giving a command. Voice controls by hitting a button on the steering wheel. and probably some other stuff I am forgetting! Oh, and no data. Plus I don't have to have my phone out.

the particular unit/car seems to make a difference. Our Jetta has Navi, and it is no where near as fancy (but still integrated) with a smaller screen. But one nice thing there is can use the app and find addresses and send them to the car. I even do it while the princess is driving which is cool!

""....Production of four U.S.-built cars, the C-Max, Focus, Fusion and Taurus, would last only through current product lifecycles. Ford also builds the Fusion at a plant in Mexico, and production of the Focus and C-Max is expected to go to Mexico. The Taurus could be discontinued or built only in a low-cost country such as China...."""
berri,Nov-15,"Ford always made Fusions in Mexico from the gitgo. They added some US capacity (Flat Rock I think), but apparently either Fusion sales can't make enough use of that 2nd line in MI, or they have some other product planned to replace it there, or Flat Rock is on it's deathbed (but I don't think so)."
Mr_Shiftright,Nov-15,I bet employee labor rates is part of this decision. It's so much cheaper in Mexico.
benjaminh,Nov-15,"I think Ford, like a few other competitors in the midsize segment, once had dreams that the Fusion could topple the Camry, or come close to it. Producing the Fusion at Flat Rock in addition to their factory in Mexico gave Ford the capacity to make maybe 450,000 or more Fusions a year—if the demand were there. But that kind of demand just isn't there for any midsize car but the Camry. The Fusion is in most ways superior to the Camry, which must be frustrating for Ford, as it is for Honda, Hyundai, Nissan, etc. The Camry is imho one of the weaker midsize cars, and yet sells in huge numbers every year based on excellent quality and reliability, and low prices.

But with Ford moving all Fusion production to Mexico, that does mean that the Sonata, Altima, Accord, Optima, Passat, and Camry, all made the the USA, will have more American content and labor put into them than the Ford, which seems strange...."

akirby,Nov-15,"Ford didn't say they were moving Fusion production out of Flat Rock - they just declined to announce production of a new Fusion model there after the current one. New one is 3-4 years away anyway which is the duration of this contract. So don't read anything into that. They may move MKZ and/or hybrid production out of Hermosillo which would free up more Fusion production there.

Fusion won't see another big jump in buyers until the next gen comes out anyway. It takes several generations of repeat buyers to build up a following like Camcords.

Although I bet Ford is perfectly happy with Fusion sales since they get $4K more for each Fusion compared to Camry. They could cut prices and move up the chart but that wouldn't help the bottom line."

benjaminh,Nov-15,"robr2 said:

Ford's Hermosillo factory has a capacity of 385,000 vehicles. They make the Fusion and the MKZ there, but since the Lincoln model is produced in small numbers, probably Ford could send c. 350k Fusions from Mexico to the US? Although perhaps it's made for other markets as well? Don't know about that.

Flat Rock has the capacity to make c. 100,000 Fusions a year, perhaps giving a potential Camry-challenging total of c. 450k. But since demand is running less than 350k a year, Flat Rock will be switched to making SUVs at some point...."

zigster38,Nov-15,"Camry fleet sales are amount to around 10-15 pct of sales. They have Hyundai pricing on leases and a reliability rep - hard to beat for the average consumer who doesn't car about engine technology and just wants to go from a to b in a car that the family and friends will approve of.  They will do what they have to to stay on top of sales numbers. 

Ford has admitted their Eco boost engines haven't been what they planned. But the Fusion  is a huge step forward over Taurus, Tempo, etc. they need another huge jump next gen to keep up. As far as plant, Consumers don't seem to care as much much anymore about where it's made. 

I i agree the dark horse to 2016 sales is the Malibu - everyone seems to like the 2016 style and if they price it well it might take a big sales jump.

I think some people do care. When you include all the jobs from the nearby factories that are suppliers, the huge Camry factory in my state is directly or indirectly responsible for tens of thousands of good-paying jobs. Same goes for the Accord in the Ohio area, the Altima in Tennessee, the Sonata in Alabama, the Optima in Georgia, etc. I like to think that when I put my hard-earned money down on a car that it's circulating and supporting jobs somewhere in the USA. It's true that some people don't care. But some people still do. Of the top five best-selling midsize cars, I think four of them are made in America. And all five of them are if you include that a significant percentage of Fusions are still made in Michigan at this point."
wayne21,Nov-15,"We rented a Malibu early this year. It was actually quite nice. We were impressed. The passenger seat went up and down which made my wife very happy - she could see out the window. The interior materials were also rather nice. The 4 cyl lacked power and was noisy, but it had plenty of room. I wouldn't want a GM product, but if I did this would be a car I'd consider (if it had a 6 cyl). The Altima was a fine rental - 40+ mpg! I wouldn't have believed that if I wasn't the one putting the gas in. I would buy this car over the Malibu if it had to be a 4 cyl. The camry was fine, but that the typical Toyota interior with the cheapest materials known to man. On our next to last trip we asked for an Altima, but they ""upgraded"" us to a buick verano. I had never heard of this car. IMHO it was a piece of crap. I think it was the worst thing we've rented in years. It was small, had the underpowered & loud GM 4cyl engine and got horrible gas mileage. The only nice thing I can say about the verano is that when we turned it in we learned to never let them give us another one of these."
ral2167,Nov-15,"Anyone give me a reason not to consider leasing a leftover 2015 Sonata Limited with an MSRP of 33K that has all the bells and whistles that I could actually use-- like the blind spot, the adaptive cruise control, the button you press that allows you take your foot off the brake while stopped at a light, the memory seats, the Android Play, and the $4000 lease cash?

If you're getting a killer deal on it, and love the car, there's no reason not to get it imho. Have you tested the competition? If you already love the Sonata you probably don't need to, esp. if you're short on time and energy. But if you have time, and haven't done it, you might try out and compare the Sonata to the Mazda6, Honda Accord, Ford Fusion, or KIA Optima."
ral2167,Nov-15,I've driven the Sonata-- I like it-- don't love it-- but all those options I mentioned that aren't available currently as a group on the other sedans-- they're intriguing. I'd get a 15K lease.
suydam,Nov-15,In my experience liking doesn't improve with age but tends to go the other way. But then I'm someone who really wants to be in a car I like a lot. But plenty of people lease cars they are ok with because of the value. If that's you go for it!
Sandman6472,Nov-15,"Drove a new Fusion last night at work and was duly impressed with everything except the mileage. Comfy with decent acceleration and ergonomically o k once I figured out the infotainment stuff. But just doesn't compare to the Camry mileage wise. But if needed a mid-size vehicle, this is one people need to try just to see what the domestics are capable of.
Whenever we bring rentals to our location at the Ford dealer, they've asked to get a Ford product if possible...and we've had success so far. Mostly Foci, Fiesta's and Fusion's in the Hertz fleet right now of Ford's offerings. But we seem to have all makes and models which is a good thing.

Do like the Malibu's also though the dash is a bit busy."
stickguy,Nov-15,"RAL, I won't. that is my car, with the 1 extra package (ultimate?) that I did not get, but nothing really in it that I cared about.

hard to argue with 4K lease cash. I don't want to think how much cheaper I could get the same car now (almost exactly 1 year to the day from when I got mine. But, i don't need another.

really is a nice car, but not something that will get your heart pumping. so, depends on what your needs are."
berri,Nov-15,"I think the 2016 Malibu is moving over to turbo engines like the Fusion eco-boost. Wonder if that will hold its sales back a bit? Newer tech in Detroit can be a bit of a gamble initially.

imidazol97,Nov-15,"berri said:


But the 2.5 L is being used in the Limited 2016 Malibu currently on the dealer lots.

The new 2016 Malibu will offer the 2.0 L Turbo and a high mileage hybrid. Keeping the 2.5L also used in the Impala would be too much overlap. If you want power, 2.0 Turbo; higher mileage (48 city), hybrid; and 1.5L Turbo 27 city/37 highway for those that think an EPA rating is so accurate that 1 or 2 mpg means they will actually see a difference between two cars in typical, day-to-day driving that's noticeable and they pick their car based on 1 mpg in rating meaning a particular model is better."
benjaminh,Nov-15,"Nissan, like Ford and Honda, used to have dreams that they might get close to the Camry in sales with the Altima, but like Ford I think they've given that up for now. But with their significantly updated 2016 Altima their new goal is to slide past the #2 car in the midsize market in sales for the past c. 15 years or so, the Accord. Here's what Nissan vice president Pierre Loing said to Automotive News:

""Altima deliveries have climbed for five straight years, and a Nissan spokesman forecasts ’16 sales will extend that streak to six. The automaker says Altima volume could reach 350,000 units next year.Loing is confident Altima can overtake the Accord in sales....""

But Honda has also refreshed the Accord for 2016, and I don't think Honda will give up second place without a fight. Nissan does sell a lot of Altimas to rental car companies, since that seems to be one of the cars I'm most often offered when on a trip."

If you drive them very carefully and are vigilant with coasting and getting your foot completely off the throttle you can get great mpg.

I would imagine rental cars would fall into the second category."

akirby,Nov-15,"Last night reminded me of one big reason I like Fords. I have a Titanium Fusion with the keyless entry. When I play tennis I throw my keys in my tennis bag and I'm able to open the doors, put the bag in the back seat and drive away. Last night after playing I had a cooler so I opened the trunk and put the cooler and my bag in the trunk. I did not unlock the vehicle - the trunk opened because the IA key was in my bag. When I closed the trunk it locked back and now all the doors and trunk were locked and the key was in the trunk. Did I call OnStar and wait 15 minutes? Did I bum a ride back home to get the spare key? Nope - I just punched in my five digit code on the keypad and unlocked all the doors and trunk in about 6 seconds. Best feature ever.

Why other mfrs have not adopted it is beyond me. I think Nissan had it for a few years. Does Ford hold a patent on it?"

zigster38,Nov-15,"I think automakers projecting all time highs for subsequent years need to be careful, economic winter could be coming in 2017. But anyway, Nissan, which is an interesting case, sells so many altimas because they discount heavily. A new 2016 Nissan Altima SR will be a sporty ride, but can they sell them without discounts? Well, maybe for two months but after that it's Rebate City. I'd be willing to say they never overtake Accord in sales. Plus they need an engine bridge before all electric cars like the leaf 2 are accepted - their 6 has done them proud for a while but it's a mpg problem and they need new engines, or buy small turbos from Mercedes. 

It's hard to believe so many companies sell so many mid size sedans every year. The next economic dip will probably remove the weaker companies mid size offerings like a Mazda, even though it's a good car. Perhaps Toyota can just sell them as rebadged Toyotas.

Well, that can depend on your financial structure and position. There's profit and there's cash flow, as well as different levels of fixed cost structure and overhead absorption. Ford put a lot of effort into the Fusion and I'm sure there is a bit of disappointment in sales. That may be partially due to the all too common issue of too many Ford products being a bit tight in interior for their external dimensions. The Fusion isn't cramped, but sitting or driving in it, it doesn't seem as generous inside as some of it's competition even though its length and width is similar.

Things like this I really focus in on because in my personal vehicle, this stuff needs to be easy peasy so do not have to take my eyes off the road. The Fusion passed my test so if I ever am in need of this size vehicle, would be on the short list.
The new Accord leaves me cold, so ugly I just can't stand it! More like an Acura when they went through their ugly period.

Have never driven either of these vehicles but love the looks and size, especially the small 1 Series. I definitely fell in love with the BMW 3 Series last year when I had to bring one to the Ft. Lauderdale airport and back for my boss. Blew me away how well it drove which is why I suggested the Audi A3 to my wife when she was car shopping last fall. A bit high price wise than she wanted to go but it met her criteria for her new ride 100%...she ended up purchasing one in early December 2014. Once she did that, I knew that I could finally look at a German vehicle for my next ride if possible. Since I had less funds and wanted new for my first toe in the German side of the pool, went with the VW Golf and 10 days later, had one in the garage trading in a perfectly good one year old Hyundai Tucson which I've never regretted for one minute!
Have promised my middle girl that I will not have a repeat performance of last year but, and that's a big big but, if I found the perfect 1 Series hardtop in my price range with somewhat low mileage, think I might jump again though it would be the dumbest most illogical thing I have ever done in my 61 year old life.Someone please, talk me off the ledge here!!!

suydam,Nov-15,I drove the Mazda 3 recently and liked it very much. It might be a bit small considering I already have a small CUV. It's my favorite of the compact cars I've looked at so far.
suydam,Nov-15,"Took a road trip to Philadelphia yesterday. Every time we do something like this I remember why we bought the Accord. For us it's the perfect long distance driver-- roomy, quiet, handles curves, mountains, good brakes, visibility -- with such ease that we arrive feeling pretty chipper. Way more fun than flying these days. The right-side camera really comes into its own when changing lanes on the turnpike. Love the XM and had my iPod for those times when I couldn't find anything on the stations we listen to. Making me think maybe the midsize category has its virtues after all."
akirby,Nov-15,"berri said:

I don't think they're disappointed at all. They're selling more high end models thus the higher ATPs (could be best in class - I know they're $4K higher than Camry and I don't think they sell as many EX-L accords but not sure). And they understand that Camcord didn't reach the top of the help in their first 9 years on the market. It's taken generation after generation and a few decades to build up enough repeat buyers to crack the 300K mark. You're not going to do that with a relatively new model no matter how good it is unless you're willing to sell it at a loss. We'll see what the 2017 refresh does - it's not a radical change but is probably enough to get current owners to upgrade. But I don't think you'll see another big jump in Fusion sales until the next generation comes out. High ATPs and a plant at 100% capacity is definitely a business success."
m6user,Nov-15,Where do you get the data that the Fusion sells for $4k a pop more than Camry? Not doubting it but just wondering where to find it. Could Camry manufacturing costs be much lower thus even though the sale price is lower they are still making good money on it? Without really knowing the financials it is impossible to say. When I was recently looking at midsize sedans I found the Accord being discounted more than the Camry. Obviously this was due to year end and a revised 2016 Accord due but I really don't think the total dealer discount numbers are that different because this market is very price sensitive. The Fusion avg sale may be higher due to many factors. Maybe the base model just doesn't have the bells and whistles that some of the others so people upgrade. I really don't know as I didn't price the Fusion in detail because I just can't stand the interiors and user interfaces of Ford products. I love how they look but every time I get inside one I just don't like them.

I really like Mazda and have had several in the past including an 80 626 coupe, 92 Miata, 96 and 98 Millenia. All enjoyable cars. What hurts Mazda is they don't have the outstanding reputation that Toyota, Honda and even Nissan have built. Granted all have had their issues, but it seems Mazda somewhat more with rust, fussy electrics, and engines such as the Miller cycle that they put in the Millenia S, and the the turbo in the CX5 and the last generation wankel all were fairly troublesome as they got older. Dealership network and service is a bit of a pain as well. For several years in the Charlotte area, the dealership network shrank to one. I do like their current product line and hope they have continued success."
roadburner,Nov-15,"In 2007 I had to go to Cincinnati to find a decent Mazda dealer, but since then one of the Louisville dealers has stepped up its game. I kept hoping that Mazda would announce the rumored 300 hp AWD Mazdaspeed3, but it looks like they aren't going to go that route. I love my 2007 MS3, but I'm ready for a change; since Mazda won't build what I want I'm looking at the current STI as well as CPO 135i M Sports- not to mention the new Mustang GT Perf. Pkg."
akirby,Nov-15,It's reported by kbb and edmunds but I think it was in a Ford sales report a few months ago. I can't find a current link. Ford sells a lot of loaded Titaniums plus Fusion is available with AWD and as a PIH which will drive up the ATP. So $4K isn't hard to believe.
robr2,Nov-15,I've read similar things as well regarding the ATP of the Fusion being higher than the Camry. Both cars cost the manufacturers similar amounts to manufacture so the profits are similar.
berri,Nov-15,You sure don't see many Fusions in the rental fleets these days. Last time I rented one was several years ago. So that's probably a good sign fore the vehicle's margins.
akirby,Nov-15,If 2 cars cost the same but one sells for $4K more that's not the same profit.
berri,Nov-15,Depends on the cost structure I suppose. I learned years ago to be skeptical of absolutes. Detroit tends to be handicapped by overhead and the UAW. I suspect you are correct on the Fusion because it is made in Mexico. But to truly compare margins you have to look at all costs over volume.

I didn't articulate that well. The profits are the similar at the MSRP price. I'm guessing Ford is selling better equipped vehicles at higher prices than Toyota."
benjaminh,Nov-15,"But my guess is that Ford probably pays their Mexican workers less than $10 hour, including benefits, while Toyota's employees in Kentucky seemingly make an average of over $40 an hour, according to the story below. The combination of higher transaction prices and lower labor costs probably means that Ford is making a decent profit on the Fusion.

What's More American Than A Ford F-150 Pickup? Try A Toyota Camry
Joann Muller
FORBES STAFF

Full-size pickup trucks are a uniquely American phenomenon, a symbol of Uncle Sam’s bravado and brawn. And the Ford F-150 is the biggest U.S. flag-bearer of all. Manufactured in Michigan and Missouri, it’s been the best-selling vehicle in America for more than three decades.

But if you want to buy a truly “American-made” vehicle — and a Cars.com survey says more Americans do — you might be better off purchasing a Toyota Camry. It turns out the Japanese carmaker’s flagship sedan actually has more domestic content in it than the F0rd pickup and in fact, ranks first in Cars.com’s annual American-Made Index.....""

Mr_Shiftright,Nov-15,"I don't think the UAW argues that *buying* American is the issue, but rather buying *made in America* is the issue."
stickguy,Nov-15,"outside of FS pickups, the midsize sedan class is still most makers bread and butter. Big sales, and loyal buyers. Plus the ""gateway"" to all the nice hi margin SUV stuff.

also a great all around package, though IMO most of them have grown a bit too large. But, you get tons of room, comfort, and MPG that rivals a compact, with much greater range (thanks to the much larger gas tanks. My Sonata has 18.5, an Elantra about 12.5, and there is not that much difference in highway MPG).

plus, the class is so competitive, can usually get a screaming good deal on something!"

""Optima Still a Stunner

Nov 16, 2015 Christie Schweinsberg | WardsAuto

....the Optima’s body is built with 150% more high-strength-steel than the outgoing third generation.

More than half of the body, including side rails and A-pillar and B-pillars, is composed of HSS which not only improves crash protection, but driving dynamics, and also makes for a quieter ride.

About that last point, the relative solitude of the cabin is perhaps the biggest noticeable change while driving a ’16 SX Turbo Launch Edition grade here last month....

Kia says it invested heavily inside the Optima, but most of the money appears to have gone to the seats.

Ours are swathed in merlot-colored Nappa leather and quilted in a diamond pattern. They are beautiful, on par with Mercedes-Benz and Audi seats....

The SX and SXL get an upgraded steering system, a rack-mounted power-driven type first seen on the new Sorento CUV.

A 32-bit processor, also on the Optima LX and EX’s column-mounted steering system, makes steering respond faster to inputs, something that was evident during our day of Colorado driving....

Real-world fuel economy is impressive....the LX 1.6T’s combined estimate is 32 mpg..."""

http://www.kbb.com/car-news/all-the-latest/best-buy-awards-midsize-car/2000011399/

""Like an athlete training a lifetime for victory, the Kia Optima has long been gunning for benchmark status among midsize sedans. The latest Optima, all new for 2016 and now in its fourth generation, has finally earned its crown.

As with any star player, the Optima's success has come through constant improvement. Throughout its life this family sedan has persevered to be better, evolving from an also-ran when it debuted 15 years ago to what it is today: a refined, advanced, rewarding-to-drive midsize sedan with luxury looks at a mainstream price.

In keeping with our automotive-athlete analogy, let's just say the outgoing Optima was no couch potato. It boasted high style, ample power and surprising amenities such as a heated steering wheel, climate-controlled seats and power-folding side mirrors. The all-new 2016 Kia Optima is even more focused, besting not only the outgoing model but edging out rivals in one of the market's most competitive segments.

The 2016 Optima, made at Kia's U.S. factory in Georgia, is available in five trims and with a choice of three engines, two of which use turbo power to do more with less. As expected from Kia, all versions bring a terrific sense of value, from a base LX with family-friendly qualities like a stain-resistant cloth interior and a height-adjustable passenger seat, to the luxury-like SXL with Nappa leather trim, 245-horsepower turbo engine and 10-speaker, 630-watt Harman/Kardon audio system. Innovative tech features include a surround-view camera, automatic emergency braking system, blind-spot monitoring and compatibility with both Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. It adds up to a midsize sedan that's easy to drive anywhere and one that feels -- and looks -- confident in any situation...."""

Ford writes a check, and the Eco-boast engines give way to something better in the next generation."

At least Kia fixed up the dashboard, though the instrument cluster looks the same and the new steering wheel is pretty ugly - reminds me of Ford's 1967 flowerpot wheel. The writer for Wards found the seats not as comfortable as they looked, and it gets pretty spendy for the top-line model with the Turbo. Still, we will see what real-world pricing looks like.

""Unlikely hitch for VW dealers
Retailers say they don't have enough vehicles

Ryan Beene
Automotive News
November 16, 2015 - 12:01 am ET
WASHINGTON -- Two months into the emissions cheating scandal that has sullied the Volkswagen brand, dealers are running into an unexpected challenge: They don't have enough vehicles to sell.

VW-brand supplies are at their lowest levels of the year, and dealers from Washington state to South Carolina say they have only a few -- and sometimes none -- of the most in-demand nameplates in stock.

Instead of seeing customers flee the brand in the wake of its emissions debacle, the VW brand posted flat year-over-year U.S. sales in October as demand for gasoline models surged amid heavy incentives, including a $2,000 loyalty discount for returning VW owners.

The deals helped VW offset the loss of diesel sales, which are frozen by the emissions-related stop-sale order. They also helped clean out much of VW's salable inventory.

Dealers say the factory incentives, bonus programs and other financial aid tools have kept them engaged, and they applauded the help from Volkswagen of America. In a sense, the diesel crisis has resulted in dealers receiving what they've sought for years: competitive pricing to go head-to-head with big players such as Honda, Ford and Nissan.

Still, the supply crunch comes just as VW begins its ""Sign Then Drive"" sales promotion, which runs through December, and it could undermine what historically are two of the brand's strongest months of the year...."""
imidazol97,Nov-15,"ab348 said:

Typical. They work at pithy quips to degrade the Malibu, despite their not having driven it. Further, they must not have driven the previous generation (13-15) or else why would know the rear legroom was longer than their Kia/Sonata models for the 14 and 15 years. They try to hide that in the mantra of the press rather than actually having sat in the cars or traveled in them in the rear seat."
akirby,Nov-15,"zigster38 said:

I don't think you understand how EPA fuel economy testing works. The regulations are very exact when you follow the rules to the letter. The EPA audits about 10% of the vehicles each year for compliance. Hyundai and Ford both had mathematical errors that inflated the results. The other issue Ford had with C-Max is they used a loophole that allowed them to use the Fusion test for C-Max (perfectly legal but in retrospect not a good idea). This had nothing to do with the actual test procedure.

The test parameters are very specific and when followed yield a repeatable test with the same results regardless of who is doing the test (within 2%). So it doesn't matter whether the mfr does the test or the EPA does the test - the results are the results and the mfrs are REQUIRED to put that number on the window sticker. The manufacturer doesn't make up these mpg numbers.

Regardless of the tests that are used, a single number will never ever be valid because in the real world the same vehicle has a huge range of results based on how it's driven. EPA might say 23 mpg combined and you can find folks who only get 15 mpg and some who get 26 mpg and everything in between. It's impossible to get a single number that matches all drivers under all circumstances."
benjaminh,Nov-15,"The 2016 Optima is a good example of the big improvements we've seen in mpg over the last 10 years, in part because of high fuel prices (until recently) and in part because of CAFE.

A 2006 Optima got an epa combined mpg of 22.

A 2016 Optima with the 1.6 turbo gets 32 mpg combined.

That's an increase of 45% for a car that's larger, more powerful, faster, and safer.

Alex on Autos seems to like the Optima best for midsize cars. He seems to rank Accord second:"

I find it funny that the Mazda6 is always mentioned as underpowered or not zoom zoom enough. What other midsize base I4 has more hp and torque that comes at comparable rpms?

m6user,Nov-15,My RDX has averaged 24.5 over the past 4K miles and it has awd and 273 hp. But so much depends on what kind of driver and what type of driving one encounters. If you're commute is stop and go and you push it a lot I think 26 mpg is decent as well.

That one seemed a little ho-hum in regard to styling both inside and out, but was nice overall. The new Civic had a crowd around it and was impressive. Found it interesting, yet not surprising that the Lexus area had a more mature crowd looking at the vehicles, no one younger than 50 than what I could tell. I am including myself as I'm 56! The Subaru area had a good crowd and got to see a Legacy that must be pretty similar to Bradd's--Premium with sunroof, silver with black cloth. Listed for $26200. I was impressed. I noticed that it has the GoodYear Assurance Fuel Max tires like my Accord. VW had a good crowd, though I heard some side discussions with the VW reps about the diesel fiasco.

What's your take on the 200. like / dislike. I have drove the 15 Malibu a lot more positive than neg but not yet in the class of Honda and some others IMO."
berri,Nov-15,"My opinion is the Honda Accord has better handling and a smoother drive train, but the Malibu is quieter and a nicer highway cruiser. That's not all bad, it gives the buyer a choice."
jpp75,Nov-15,"brian125 said:


Well I generally try to avoid them after having them a few times. I'll search out something else if possible. It's definitely an improvement on the prior generation, but still not really competitive with the rest of the segment. I find the 4 cylinder to be a bit harsh and the 9 speed transmission is always hunting for a gear. I was trying to think of what I liked about it, and really nothing comes to mind. That's not saying it's all bad, just nothing good is that memorable."

Previous owning a 2013 Accord I'd have to agree with you on Malibu's quieter cabin and not as smooth drive train. I could not tell a difference with both vehicles on hwy thou. Accord has a firmer suspense which on city streets you could tell the difference between both cars."
backy,Nov-15,"I've driven the 200 and driving-wise it was ""fine"", nothing exceptional but not bad either. However, I got a sense of claustrophobia inside it. The rear seemed especially cramped, whether psychologically or in reality. And I disliked having to use the touch screen to perform simple functions; I prefer real buttons and knobs.

My 13 Genesis R-spec is a sharping looking car. This car by far gets the most compliments out of all the vehicles I owned. The new 15 Genesis w, that big ugly grille is hard on the eyes. Inside the 2015 its luxurious and beautiful .The new Genesis suspensions (3 modes ) is so much better than previous years and starting to get closer to the German made vehicles. Nice bang for your buck but not there yet.

My son bought the Bmw 3 last year after looking at the Mazda6. He felt as I that for 30k plus not enough ponies under the hood. I'd like to see the Mazda 6 with a turbo or upgrade motor . May help them in the sales dept.

I got a chance to drive a 16, Malibu, Had a Turbo 2.0 w/ 8sp trans . Felt fast , trans shifted nicely and was very quite inside cabin. This newer model rides exceptional. Still felt small inside for me at almost 6'2 but I could make due if I had to drive it. GM has a winner on its hands here.

@stickguy. I agree about the power of the Mazda6. It has as much or more hp and torque than others coming on at lower rpms as well but all you hear on forums and in just about every review is ""no zoom zoom"". I think because the Mazda is more of a drivers car the take rate might be a little higher especially if the MPGs are decent."

an AWD 300 HP 3 hatch certainly piques my interest!"
m6user,Dec-15,"Yeah, I didn't say anything about a speed6. I read in at least two articles that Mazda officials at the LA show were hinting that it could be seen in the 6 and the speed3. It would just fill in where the 6 cyl used to be in the 6 and a tuned version for the speed3. They are all just rumors at this point and that's why I was wondering why someone would come out and say the 6 isn't getting as if they actually knew something."
[Deleted User],Dec-15,"Hey gents. It has been awhile. First, for those who are new-new; I still have the 2012 Optima EX in Spicy Red with about $1,200 in dealer and aftermarket options, such as 35% tinted windows (with the little gloss black B-pillar accent pieces), Kicker Bi-Amped 800w RMS stereo with all kicker speakers and 2-10""s in the trunk.(they fit perfect between the strut towers). Stock head unit remains for steering wheel control function retention and for fooling thieves. Also, all interior and even license plate tag lights are LED and red to match the I/P and other interior lights. I have a drop-in K&N Filter as well. Lastly, OEM rear spoiler painted matching factory color, and factory mud guards I found on e-bay on the cheap at the same time I ordered the spoiler.

Miles: 46,560
Warranty repairs: 1
Explanation:
The high pressure fuel pump died at 42k. There was a recall and I had the work done, however it was only 2 weeks before she died regardless. Fortunately, the Optima 2.4 also has a low pressure fuel pump that allowed me to still drive it to the dealer for service. It is there for fuel economy at low engine loads but it FELT like NASA type redundancy. I was very proud I was not left stranded and it did not impact any activities except the 1.5 hours it took to put in a new pump for free, and change the oil.

Minor Irritation: Center console latch has partially broken twice. This means one screw came out and only one remained. I am a big guy and use it constantly so I chalk it up to partially my fault....but I bet it would not have happened in an Accord or a Camry. Both times replaced under warranty. I did not add it to warranty repairs because the console latch did still function and it was really over-used as I fool with my Vape unit and previously cigarettes before I quit smoking.

Condition: I went to look at the 2015 Mustang and drove the Ecoboost Premium 6 speed stick.
Their appraiser gave it a ""Good"" and offered me $14,000. I owe $2,100 but after bringing the kids to test the back seats, we were alarmed that the Ford design team apparently forgot that people,.,,,even kids, have legs. I was then unable to buy the car, although sawing legs off did cross my mind. LOL.

Hint: if you have a mid-life muscle car crisis but also have kids...the Challenger has real seats and the Charger IMO is a prettier car now and has 4 doors AND real seats.

Performance: Still strong though 200 HP is just adequate. Northing much more.


Looking for DEQ info (Emissions) right now so I can get my tags before they expire at the end of the month. No problems anticipated.

It has been a great car. I love it still."
Mr_Shiftright,Dec-15,Thanks for the long-term comments! Was it easy to notice the pump failure? Does it throw a warning light or ...??
Sandman6472,Dec-15,"Drove a brand new 2016 Sonata and Optima today and give the interior of the Sonata the win here but prefer the exterior of the Optima. Both very nice vehicles and acceleration is excellent in both. The dash of the Sonata was just nicer looking with ergonomics just about perfect. Seems like Hyundai/Kia is improving leaps and bounds over the Camry and Accord which is a good thing as maybe the Japanese twins will up their game, finally.
Like the suttle changes of the Altima and even liked the new Fusions I saw. Still waiting to drive the new Renegade but we did get a whole bunch in by the airport. Saw new Jetta S's with the 1.4t engines but was perplexed about the tires/rims combos. Some had 17"" ones while the other half had 18""ers on really nice alloys. Up until this year, all the Jetta's have had hub caps whether they be ""S"" or ""SE"" version. For those who do not mind purchasing ex-rentals, once these go up for sale, they should be very happy people. Still haven't seen any 2016 Malibu's yet but figure once January 1st comes and goes, they'll start popping up in the new car receiving area.
Guess Hertz really is stepping up and getting much needed new iron into our fleet. Today we made several trips to the maintenance area and picked up some very nice vehicles for our HLE locations which is very good for our customers since we are the only store out west in Southwest Broward County.

I enjoy reading your impressions of various cars, even though many I am not familiar with. I am glad to see you mentioned the Malibu. But I believe the Malibu Limited is being continued for the 2016 model year for the rental market. The new Malibu with the 1.5L turbo engine won't go into the fleet/rental area for a while. The 2016 Malibu Limited is the 2015 with a few downgrades in some options but they look the same externally. The dealers have been getting them in to sell for months. I still haven't found a dealer who has a 2016 Malibu in this area."
nyccarguy,Dec-15,"@cski - thanks for checking back in. Good to see you've still got the Optima. Great color & a slick looking car. So many times when car shopping or car looking practicality wins over everything else. I've said on other forums here that I'm very happy with my 2015 Legacy. Like you (with your Optima), I find its 175 horsepower engine's power adequate. Does it blast onto the highway with reckless abandon? Uh.... no. It does just fine keeping up with rush hour traffic. I set my cruise at 70 and usually don't go faster unless I've got to pass.

I look at a car like a Fusion Titanium AWD, price it out with every possible incentive and the best lease rates. Or an Acura TLX V6 AWD. I'm sure I'd like either car. The Fusion would cost a little less than my current $405.07 payment, while the Acura's lease payment would be a little higher. But then I'd have to watch my miles, fork over an extra $1000 up front (bank fee & new plates), and figure out what I'm going to do 3 years from now (when I would have the Legacy for 4 years). I've started to pay extra towards the Legacy and once our Pilot is paid off in May, I can double up on my Legacy payments."
berri,Dec-15,"Hopefully, the slow roll out means GM is being careful not to incur any negative surprises in the press on this one. I'm a little concerned that they have put all their eggs in the direct ignition, turbo 4 cylinder basket."
Sandman6472,Dec-15,"Drove a 2016 Sonata yesterday and was very impressed. Similar dashboard to the Optima though liked the steering wheel controls and the radio better in the Sonata. Radio display is much cleaner with multiple station choices that was somewhat easy to set favorite stations. Seating material was quite good and should stand up well in day to day driving, especially liked the front headrest design. No problem getting up to speed on 595 as I left the Ft. Lauderdale airport area and it drove really nice. Steering was straight and true and there was ample power when needed to pass on the expressway. All in all, a total win for Hyundai/Kia here. 2016 Optima I drove recently drove almost the same so really a toss up here as to which one a person purchases if the choice is between these two. Figuring that the fleet models are the base cars of most that Hertz purchases and would just think the upper level vehicles would have extra/better creature comforts. But these two vehicles are very very good mid sized vehicles and I wouldn't have an issue owning either if we needed such a big vehicle.

The Sandman"
Sandman6472,Dec-15,"Can't wait to go to work tomorrow to see what new vehicles have arrived at the drop off area by the airport. New transports are arriving daily and there are vehicles parked all over just waiting to be put into the system to be rented. Being that winter break starts in just two weeks from now, things are going into overdrive to get these vehicles on the road. Have not seen any of the new Tucson's yet being the new 2016 models are out. Figure it's just a matter of time before these make it to the lot. Sure they will drive just like the outgoing model I used to own...Hyundai did a great job with the new model at least on the exterior as I've yet to see the inside. The new Sante Fe I have driven do look good inside and out and am sure the new Tucson will just mimic the interior of the Sante Fe. It's basically a 3/4 Sante Fe as it is.
The new Jeep Cherokee drives really well and I see that there are many new Jeep Compass's at the lot now. Like the size but think with the new Renegade there also, there is no longer a need for the Compass since it is a bit bare bones inside and not that comfortable to drive. If I were to buy, I'd definitely skip the Compass and get the Renegade as it is a nicer looking vehicle and is fresh looking to be honest. Doubt Jeep sells that many Compass's in the first place especially with all the negatives.

backy,Dec-15,"I see the IIHS Top Safety Pick+ list is out for 2016, and several mid-sized family sedans made the list:

Chrysler 200
Honda Accord
Mazda 6
Subaru Legacy
Toyota Camry
Volkswagen Jetta

Interesting how IIHS considers the Jetta to be ""mid-sized."" Notably absent from the list are the Fusion, all-new Malibu (a Malibu ""only available to fleets"" made the Top Safety Pick list, not Pick+), all-new Optima, nearly-new Sonata, and the Altima. Special shame should be heaped on GM and Hyundai/Kia for their new or nearly-new designs not ace-ing the latest safety tests. Funny how the low-volume Mazda 6 and Legacy can get on this list, and some of the Big Boys can't figure out how to do it.

On a side note, I was glad to see the Mazda 3 make the Pick+ list for small cars. It's looking more and more likely that will be my next car (2014-5 model, 6M, red) when I'm in the market again a little over a year from now."
explorerx4,Dec-15,"Although it initially confused me, one thing about my Fusion I have come to appreciate is the hill descent feature.
It shuts off the fuel and will downshift at least up to 2 gears to help maintain your speed.
You tap the brakes to set the speed and it takes over. You may gain some speed, but it really saves the brakes."
suydam,Dec-15,I drove the automatic version of the 3 a couple of months ago. Loved it! It might replace my Accord in a couple of years. I like how the hatch and sedan have almost identical profiles.
Sandman6472,Dec-15,"Think the 3 is just awkward looking with it's huge hood and short rear deck...just looks out of sync to me. The wife almost got another but the smallish speedo on the 2.5 version killed it for her. She also didn't like the infotainment set up though it's almost identical to the one in her A3. And it was I who suggested the A3 as she thought the 3 was a tad too big for her this time around. The dealerships are across the street from each other with the Audi store within our development, so store distance was not an issue.
Funny, I've seen more A3's down here than 3's for some reason. And at Hertz, have not seen any of the new 3 or 6 for that matter and the last generation few that we had are few and far between now. Surprised they aren't more prevalent in our fleet lately but that could change I'm sure.

akirby,Dec-15,IIHS keeps upping the requirements for top safety pick every year. Some vehicles that were top picks last year and have not changed are not top picks this year. Therefore I don't put much stock in these ratings.
suydam,Dec-15,"I drove the 2016 which has the new infotainment system. It's terrific. What I like about the hood is that you can clearly see where it ends. My Accord I'm always guessing how close to the concrete curb it is when parking. And it turns on a dime. But I'm a bit partial to Mazdas, having owned a few over the years."

Precisely."
imidazol97,Dec-15,"akirby said:

IIHS operates like the EPA has been where they are setting the laws (requirements) rather than evaluating what is out there. Now they are mandating active forward collision braking to get a top ranking: not just a warning like my Malibu has of an impending collision potential.

The behavior of the car during a collision which has been artificially set up in a lab situation likely won't mirror your collision with another vehicle, such as in the offset front collision standard. I would like to see also the IIHS repeat collision tests they do with a different example of the same brand vehicle; I suspect they might get varying results.

I view the results as an indicator of the body's ability to absorb a collision's forces in the same manner that the EPA's fuel mileage ratings indicate what a driver might get if they drove under 55 and in a specific manner. The manufacturers design to the crash test just as they engineer the engines and drive trains to maximize mileage in the specific testing ranges the EPA uses."
suydam,Dec-15,I'm all for raising the bar. The continual improvement in safety would not have happened without requiring them.
akirby,Dec-15,"imidazol97 said:show previous quotesWell said. I think we've reached the point where these additional tests and requirements are not going to translate to further reductions in real world deaths and injuries.My real problem is when they raise the bar for newer vehicles they imply that the older vehicles that were previously top picks are no longer safe and that's just ridiculous. It's like grading on a curve where this year a grade of 90 is an A, but a few years later a grade of 90 is a F because all vehicles are above 90.We've reached the point of diminishing returns but if IIHS admitted that then we don't need them any more."

I agree completely. There's point where common sense is lost."
Mr_Shiftright,Dec-15,"Safety picks are tricky to totally rely on, because the complex dynamics of an auto accident really cannot be predicted by a few types of crash test. There's no such thing as a ""safe car"" anyway, and these days, the degree of risk from car to car might not be so great. Having said that, if a car exhibited a marked deficiency in any one test, conspicuously worse than any other in its class, I'd pay attention to that.

Hey Sandman. You know, I did not dig the looks of the new Sonata at all at first glance.....until I saw more and more of them...and then did a complete ""about face"". The last model was all organic and pinched in the front (like mine but even more pronounced). It was revolutionary at the time, but now looks a bit plasticy and I have no idea which models are Turbo's, 2.4's with dual exhaust, SE trim with single exhaust....just cornfused. base models on the old car (GLE?) was hard to pick out except for the hubcaps, and no fog lights.
Anyway, a lot of magazines said the design was a step ""back"" in design. I totally disagree now. It is a very nice looking car. Sharp and angular where it needs to be; but still curvy and sexy looking. I really like it. The DRL's and the distinctive taillights are a nice touch, and the interior loks to be a nice office.I give it two thumbs up.

I am terribly sorry, but I can't get the driving dynamics of the Mustang Ecoboost Premium out of my mind. It makes my cars handling just suck. Especially the brakes. Linear and really effective on the 'stang, they feel like rubber on the Optima.

Hyundai Kia......listen up. Driving dynamics is where you are losing almost all the way around. You have proven you can have a gorgeous, reliable car for lots less dough than the competition, and they stand behind their products. Put some good struts/shocks on the Optima and a good set of front brakes with 2 pistons at least, and work on body rigidity and handling as a whole.

Congrats on the new car man. I hope it drives as good as it looks."
sda,Dec-15,"imidazol97 said:show previous quotesI agree completely. There's point where common sense is lost.The advances made to protect the cabin space, control g forces, and limit occupant movement is great. It is especially telling in the test against the 59 Chevy and 09 Chevy. The driver in the 59 had no chance and the driver in the 09 probably was just bruised up. One thing that I question is how would the passenger side and passenger fare in similar collisions? Seems they only test the driver's front and side in these collisions. How often to we hear that the passenger was killed--right side collision, but the driver was ok? Do they even test the passenger side?"
suydam,Dec-15,"Saw Alex on Autos review of the 2016 Honda Accord. According to the review the extra safety features now come bundled with Nav and are a $2k add-on to the EX-L. When we shopped in 2013 that's how the Altima packaged its safety features too. Since we don't want Nav that was a major reason we went with the Accord. The Ex-L came in 2 versions, with and without Nav, and all the safety features were standard. I'm not sure we would buy an Accord again if they keep that setup."

But if I were shopping now for a mid-sizer, and assuming it's for my own use, I'd focus on the base Accord and Mazda6, each with the 6MT. I don't want or need a lot of doo-dads on my car. I'd probably also take a good look at the base Legacy, Sonata 1.6T, and Passat 1.8T, especially if there's big incentives on them (which is likely at this time of year).

benjaminh,Jan-16,"C & D likes the 2016 Optima 1.6T:

""....Available only in the LX 1.6T, the 1.6-liter is designed to be the most economical offering of the bunch (apart from the Optima hybrid, still based on the previous-gen car), and its EPA ratings of 28/39 mpg city/highway are at the top of the class. Its seven-speed dual-clutch automatic, however, is a welcome break from the rising tide of CVTs in this category. It credibly mimics the smoothness of a torque-converter automatic at low speeds and delivers well-timed shifts under acceleration. That acceleration is pretty spry for a green guy, aided by the fact that the Optima LX 1.6T danced across our scales at 3241 pounds—more than 300 pounds less than the 2.0-liter SX. That figure is about on par with a four-cylinder Honda Accord.

It’s also more than 200 pounds lighter than the Ford Fusion 1.5-liter EcoBoost, which is perhaps the Optima LX 1.6T’s most direct competitor. In a battle between those two eco-misers, the Kia shines. Engine output is pretty much a draw—the Kia’s 1.6-liter makes 3 fewer horsepower but 10 lb-ft more torque than the Ford’s 1.5-liter EcoBoost—but the Optima’s fuel economy is better by 3 mpg in the city and 2 mpg on the highway (and that’s spotting the Fusion its optional auto stop-start system). And when it’s time to put your foot down, the Kia’s 7.3-second zero-to-60 time trounces the Ford’s 8.2-second result....""

Mr_Shiftright,Jan-16,Why doesn't the Mazda6 do better? Is it the engine?
stickguy,Jan-16,"Small dealer network and ad budget. It's a very nice call, just a niche player. The 4 cyl is as good or better than the competition, and even models that offer a bigger engine have overwhelming sales of the base motor.

Also more sporty, so not great for typical Camry appliance buyer."
andres3,Jan-16,"stickguy said:

Sounds like there's a need for the Mazda Speed 6 again, they probably could eliminate the standard 4 cylinder to optimize costs for a better engine. Also, they should go back to offering luxury like 4 year bumper to bumper warranties instead of the pedestrian 3 year/36K mile version."

No brainer right? Was for us. Stickguy nailed it. It is niche and much, much smaller company. The 3 is their bread and butter with CX-5 coming in 2nd. They sell about as many 6's as they can make and send over from Japan. Legacy doesn't sell a whole lot more. Same story to some degree......very good car but kind of niche."
Mr_Shiftright,Jan-16,"The Mazda engine is 184 HP, so it's not strong for its class these days."
suydam,Jan-16,"Same as the Honda Accord which is plenty for me, and sells quite well. And the handling and maneuverability are much better. But yes, if you like MORE POWER it probably isn't for you."
explorerx4,Jan-16,"Regarding a Fusion, I'll chime in, since I have a 2013. The 2.0 is considered to be the better engine, but drive each an make up your own mind. I like power of the 2.0 on the hills we have. Fusion is heavier than most of the competition, so it's not going to be quite as fuel efficient. I have the Titanium model, so it's got a lot of bells and whistles."

Perfectly adequate. If the lease deals are as good this fall as they have been the last few months, it could be a serious contender for my next ride."

brian125,Jan-16,"m6user said:



Agree with a lot what your saying on the Mazda front . Here is the flip side to the mazda6 and probably why sales are lagging. Small market . Better leased deals on the other vehicles . Buyers who don't like driven a 4cyl. Folks buying have a lot of good choice in segment with Altima, Accord, Sonata all close in MPG's all bigger inside including Fusion than the 6 . Mazda's Front seats and quarters are very tight inside cabin for bigger people. I hit my head getting in / out of the mazda6 every time. Wind / Cabin noise is terrible. ( always been a problem with Mazda's ) Front seat comfort. Back seat . The family guy does not want this vehicle.

I agree ride and handling is exceptional in the Mazda6 just isn't appealing to most family midsize sedan buyers.

Go after that younger driver that might not want to pay BMW prices. With some better marketing and tweaking the zoom could be the answer."
suydam,Jan-16,Especially now that the interior and tech is actually nicer than the other midsizers.
nyccarguy,Jan-16,"benjaminh said:

In my opinion, there is nothing that the Mazda 6 does that is so amazing. Yes it handles great & comes with a stick shift, but that's not enough to set it apart from the pack. Your Camry & Accord buyers are always going to buy Camrys & Accords. The people who want AWD (yours truly included) are going to buy a Legacy.

So now you've got your undecided shopper who wants something different. Your 1st stop is the Nissan dealer. You see a lot of Altimas on the road. Depending on what you are looking for, it is hard to say no to a cheap lease or mega discount & cheap financing. The 3.5L V6 isn't the best seller, but is still an option.

The Sonata & Optima also offer a nice looking package, great mpg, BIG discounts, & cheap leases, plus a turbo motor option.

The Fusion? Gorgeous. No slouch in the performance department with the optional 2.0 Turbo engine. Big discounts & lots of rebates.

Then you head to your Mazda store. You've read all the magazine comparos, you are an enthusiast, you dig the styling, the interior is top rate. There aren't so many Mazda dealers as the others, so you are offered a good deal, but nothing that blows you out of the water. The 185hp motor is adequate, but doesn't exactly go zoom zoom.

What does Mazda need to do to win more buyers? Offer AWD as an option. Offer a turbo motor with 250 - 260 hp."
stickguy,Jan-16,"I believe that Mazda also doesn't have capacity to make a ton more 6's for the US anyway. Certainly could never compete with the 1/4 million sellers. Dealer network is kinda small too.

but, yes, it is for a certain type of buyer. Enthusiasts? People that like what BMWs used to be, and are on a budget?

Takes all kinds."
suydam,Jan-16,"Mazda is a smaller market player with fewer dealers nationwide. It's overall sales are up. I think they're doing just fine. Like everybody else, they're selling fewer midsize sedans and more crossovers."

This is true.  Their sales are up, they are small but profitable.  Obviously the volume matters, but they don't need to try and sell 400,000 + Camrys like Toyota does."
brian125,Jan-16,Wasn't Mazda's rotary engines Rx8 / Rx7 vehicles somewhat fast? If I'm correct back then Mazda's sold plenty of these cars. Low end torque and mpg's were the knock on them. Never drove one but did drive a couple of 1995 / 1996 Nissan 300zx. Very fast vehicles handled great. I have seen only 1 in the last 10 years and remember thinking how small it looked.............. but what a car..

litesong2,Jan-16,"Love the terrain you travel, enough to slow down & enjoy the views longer. Set CC three mph under your normal pace. As you approach rises & shallow hills, slowly accelerate to three mph above your normal pace. As the hill tilts up, don't lose any speed or you lose the advantage of your acceleration. As the hill approaches its steepest slope, slowly decrease speed, till, as you reach the hill top flat, you are again, three mph below your normal pace & the CC takes control. If any hill is too steep to hold high gear as you ascend, shift to lower gears BEFORE you reach the hill. Also, Elantra responds from 6% to 8% higher mpg, by using 100% ethanol-free gasoline(E0). Pump tires to 40psi. There are other methods & it pays to use them. Our 2013 auto & 2016 manual Elantras average 39mpg with 15% city driving & using E0. Both Elantras have reached 43mpg & 46mpg."

Also the Hyundai/Kia duo topped every over mid-sizer in sales in December except the Camry. That seems like a lot of interest to me.

I noticed Kia borrowed the Sonata's dash design for the 2016 Optima. I don't think that's a good thing, as I liked the old Optima's dash and the Sonata's (and now the Optima's) is kinda boring, although the layout of the controls is simple.

The 1.6T engine would be my choice for either the Sonata or Optima. I'd love to see Hyundai drop that motor into the all-new 2017 Elantra, but alas while it's getting a turbo option it's only 1.4L--but it will have the 7-speed DCT.

Only issue was when the radiator overflow bottle came unhooked from it's holder (poor design) and got a hole in it from rubbing on a belt/pulley.  I noticed it a day before I was leaving on a long driving vacation.  Dealership didn't have one in stock and couldn't get one for a day.  But when I explained the situation, they took one off a demo and I was on my way.  Great service by them. Only other service visit was the oil/filter change.  

My mileage over the year has averaged a shade over 30 mpg with 60/40 hwy/city driving.  Power with the 4 cyl is enough for me and I love the mileage.  Car is still tight with no rattles or wind leaks.  Nothing to complain about with it, which is just how I like it.  Not exciting to drive, but I'll trade that for no-drama reliability all day long.

suydam,Jan-16,"It is not as cartoonish as the Juke. That is in a category by itself. That said, once they enlarged the Altima and made its interior nicer, the Maxima kind of lost its distinctive identity in the lineup. That's the bigger problem."
stickguy,Jan-16,"well, at this point, I think the Maxima is definitely separated from the Altima. Style wise, in and out, and feature content. Whether that helps sales, remains to be seen.

I also know a couple of people that have Jukes, and love them. Both women, though I suspect that is 98% of the owners of that. I like the concept, just a bit overstyled for my taste."
suydam,Jan-16,"As they say, there is a buyer for every car. We drove one last February at the same time we drove the Encore. Aside from the exterior we both hated every aspect of it. The interior was cheap and extremely cramped. Seats were extremely uncomfortable. Ride was rough and loud. It could not have been a bigger contrast with the Encore. Or even with Nissan's own larger Rogue which is a very nice vehicle.
In regards to the Maxima, I owned an '01 and loved it. But the new ones look too large and bulky for my taste. And I'm really surprised they changed out that sweet V6 engine for a CVT."
Sandman6472,Jan-16,"Kinda like the Juke in a strange way, and agree, have only seen women driving them. If not for the dismal mileage figures, would have the kid check it out...but will show it to her at the Miami International Car show in November. Like I've said, I want her to try everything out there so she makes an informed decision.
Was a bit surprised at the smallish changes in the new Altima, very hard to tell the differences in the new model. We have a lot of them at work and folks seem to like them just the same.

The Maxima's distinctive identity is a ""4-Door Sports Car or 4DSC as Nissan puts it on the window. My rental of a couple years back suggests false advertising. It was more of a 4-door boat than sports car. The only thing sporty about it was the engine, everything else was sub-par."

Let me put it this way. I think you know I have no love lost for GM. I traded this rental into Hertz for a Camaro RS rental special for my track weekend due the the S4 being out of commission.Part of the problem was it had like 50K miles as a rental perhaps, and it also smelled of cigarettes (which I hate). In the end for the track weekend they may have been equally fun cars. Lots of people said a Focus would have been more fun despite the low power output it apparently has a solid chassis."

Great point. When I started driving in 1972, I could buy gas (leaded regular) for 29 cents a gallon. Which I thought was cheap, although I was a poor high school student at the time. And the mid-sized car I drove, a '66 Coronet, got about 20 mpg average with its Slant 6 and 3-speed automatic. Today I saw $1.49 at a gas station near me... which in inflation-adjusted dollars is less than gas cost in 1972! So the fact that many of today's mid-sized cars can average over 30 mpg isn't a big deal for lots of people. I still think it's pretty amazing, though.

So about the post above mine... I was looking to get a compact car when the lease on my Rio5 expires in a few months. But with the great deals on, and great fuel economy of, today's mid-sized cars, I might have to look at mid-sizers. For example, the new 2017 Elantra lists for $20k with what I consider basic equipment, and its fuel economy (2.0L) isn't much better than an Accord or Mazda6. I've seen leases on some mid-sizers for under $200/month sign-and-drive, for 36 months... hard to beat."
brian125,Feb-16,"Backy, I agree .

Its hard to pass up on a Accord , Mazda6 or any midsizer with the extra interior rm. and 36 to 40 mpg.
Sonata, Camry, Altima's, Jetta's can pretty much be had for 200 a month ."
stickguy,Feb-16,"I went through this before I got my Sonata. I was real close to getting a Mazda 3 instead, but the bigger size fit a lot better (my wife really found the extra room desirable). It did not cost much more on a monthly basis, was way more roomy and comfortable, got close to the same MPG, and had a lot better highway cruising range with the bigger tank."
brian125,Feb-16,Sonata has the most interior room out of all midsizers. Has anyone top it yet?
brian125,Feb-16,"Looks like the 2016 Ford fusion is close.

http://www.iseecars.com/cars/top-10-midsize-sedans-with-most-interior-room"
stickguy,Feb-16,"I have never been able to figure out how they measure interior room (my impression isn't always the same!), but the Sonata has a ton of room, especially in the back seat. 2nd only to the Passat from my experience. That is a baby Limo. They are full sized cars to me."
backy,Feb-16,"Speaking of back seat room... I test drove a 2017 Elantra today because the dealer was offering a dozen roses, delivered (just in time for Valentine's Day) so how could I turn that down? I noticed by the specs that it seemed a little tighter inside than the prior generation, and sure enough, the back seat seemed more cramped to me. Knee room was fine, but toe space was tight. What's so great about lots of knee room if you can't put your feet under the front seat, so your knees are up in the air?

I've found that interior dimensions can be misleading. They don't take into account things like toe space and rear seat cushion height, which have a lot to do with how comfortable rear passengers are. True mid-sizers like the Passat and Sonata have a big (no pun intended) advantage over marginal ""mid-sized"" cars like the Elantra in that regard... although the Jetta and Corolla have quite a roomy rear seat for ""compacts""."
stickguy,Feb-16,"at this stage, I rarely have back seat passengers, and if I do, probably not large ones. So roomy up front but a little tight in the back isn't a problem to me."

[Deleted User],Feb-16,"stickguy said:

Hey guys. One of the reasons the Optima became a front runner choice...and eventually the one I brought home to stay was the roomy back seat. I am 6'2"" and 260. I can sit comfortably in the back seat, with my own A/C vents and USB ports for phone charging. On a 2012, that was sweet on a car stickering for $24,260. Considering it is still beautiful and failure free (never left me stranded) after 4 years and 47k; is a testament to Hyundai/KIA and their quest to build quality, long lasting cars. Of course just to be obtuse it seems Car and Driver had an article with a sidebar of 10 cars that needed suspension reworks.The BMW 328 AND the 340 M Sport was #1 on the list. This made me feel a great deal better as mine was 10th.

Anyway, On the 2016 version of my Optima the tester/author said: ""Never feels like one axle knows what the other is experiencing"".
-E. Johnson

Well, Mr Johnson. Since it has 4 wheel independent suspension, isn't that the whole point? I don't want to be jostled around just so I can ""feel"" my right rear wheel hit a 7"" deep and wide pothole. I don't want my kids to feel impacts through the frame while they are jamming to whatever kids listen to these days. I don't want to feel strong impacts either. It is a family sedan that LOOKS like a sports sedan. Just a sweet looking Camry.It is not a BMW. However, I have never had an issue with control, quick lane changes to avoid objects (a chair) that fell off a Beverly Hillbilly Design Studios (BHDS) HD Pick-em-up truck, or braking issue's that has elicited an ""oh my god oh my god were all gonna die"". I do think the brakes are the the biggest weak point. After driving a bottom - end Mustang Eco-boost. I could not believe how bad my brakes felt in comparison.

I also wanted to tell you guys I am $1,775 away from it being paid for. Paying $50 extra each month allowed me to pay it off a whole year early....and now I can concentrate on my 50"", 4,000k TV for the living room. (I have a 40"" now the is just ""meh"") The 40"" will replace the 32"" in my room, and that will go to the kids room. Everybody wins.

Great car, Average to good service, affordable, average F/E, and I STILL look back and admire it as I walk in the store.

So, you guys have known me from beginning to end of the ""making payments"" era of this 2012 Optima. I plan on keeping it. It still has 53k and 6 more years of warranty left. Will keep everyone updated as it ages..and what I plan on buying next. It will have lots more power. That's all I know now."
nyccarguy,Feb-16,"@cski - Good for you Chris.  Having a car almost paid for is a fantastic feeling.  In May, our 2011 Pilot will be paid off.  I also started paying an extra $200 per month towards the Legacy.  Once the Pilot is paid for, I will start to double my Subaru payments & pay that off long before the end of the 6 year loan I took out on it.

What I did not like about his G37 was terrible road noise( to me awful.) The Suspensions firm ride with driving on very bad Staten Island, NY roads makes this Uninspiring for a mature driver.

I know our company has a bunch of them and most of their 9 speed trannys are a bit wacko. Drove one back to the office on Monday and was told to check out the 9 speed and yep, it was a bit wonky. Personally think 9 is just too many forward speeds, where 6 is probably the optimal number. Besides this major issue, the vehicle isn't all that bad though think the others are just much better. Glad to see that most companies have gotten the message that we small vehicle drivers want the same things as our mid size brothers. Nice to see small vehicles just shrunken copies of their bigger siblings because at this stage of our lives, a small vehicle is the perfect fit and I won't go smaller than 165"" as to me, a Spark is just too small...just want some extra room and the compacts are the perfect size.

Starting to warm up to the new Civic, Honda had great success back in 2006 with that radical design, and liked it so much I even bought one late in the first year of production. Looks like history is trying to repeat itself with the 2016 model but one difference, I won't be purchasing one. Will show my kid one when she wants to start her search as the interior is truly top notch. Honda really does make great products, it's just that many others are making more exciting ones, if you guys get what I'm trying to convey here. Granted, the new Civic and HR-V have that""wow factor"" and should do pretty well in the future but there are so many other makes and models who also have that same thing, that will get a lot of those sales. This is great for the auto industry as a whole and for the buying public because there are so many good choices.

akirby,Mar-16,FCA is simply positioning itself to be bought by another company. They cut incentives on the Dart and 200 and sales fell through the floor (down 60% I think). Their month over month sales increases were due to big incentives and isn't sustainable long term. Jeep and maybe RAM trucks (and Pacifica) are the only likely survivors.

I like what I'm seeing and reading about the New 2017 Ford Fusion it checks a lot of my wants in a vehicle for under 40k and 300 plus h/p . Hopefully this new model's cockpit will be more open and friendly like my Genesis. The new 15, 2016 exterior Genesis got hit with the big ugly stick. Inside is beautiful.

I can get the basic 5.0 ""Coyote"" V8 GT for $26,999, but there is NO WAY I am gong to ""go for it"" and not get leather, the nicer wheels, and the MFT2 with the larger screen, although I personally thing it is a horrible to put a screen that low. Here in traffic world, taking your eyes off the road for 3 or 4 seconds is not a good idea. All I know is that I am going to keep posting about the life span of my Optima as long as I have it...and still admire it.
Right now I'm happy with the basics.  My Legacy has cloth seats (heated), an automatic (CVT), a spacious interior, AWD, a big trunk, and I can go at least a week between filling up due to the generous size of its 18.5 gallon tank.  It's suspension is well damped (not firm, not mushy) for daily driving.  

For my next car, motor is a priority.  I obviously won't go for a cheapo interior and crummy ride for the sake of speed, but I don't need the car to be loaded up either.

I don't particulaly care if gas goes back up to $3 or $4 per gallon because it won't affect there vehicle I buy.

Since I am happy with Subaru (coming up on 30K miles) thus far, the most logical choice for me would be a WRX Limited.  

Every time I see a current generation GTI it turns my head, but If I get that then I'd have to spring for a set of winter wheels & tires.  So I might as well stick with a WRX.  

A CPO ex-loaner A3 2.0 Quattro might fit the bill.  Same chassis as the GTI performance package, AWD, but I'd need to find one with the right wheels & sport suspension.  I'd also better have a damn good reason to tell my wife that I'd like to trade my Subaru in for a used Audi.

I don't know what it is, but I'd also love to give the 2016 Tacoma TRD Sport a ride around the block.  I have no need for a pickup truck, but could find uses for one very fast.  Plus the resale value on then is nuts."

Ah yes, a cross-shopper after my own heart. Like you, I'm not all that excited about stuffing my cars with gadgets- but having said that I do enjoy all the connectivity and media options in my 2 Series. I also like the fact that the car has a volume knob and that the iDrive knob can be configured as a tuning knob(I'm not all that excited about touch screens in a car). One more thing I like is how the IP has a secondary display between the speedometer and the tach that can display the audio and/or navigation status- so if you want to change stations you can simply glance at the IP cluster rather than over at the primary screen. I don't know what other brands offer that feature, but I really like it."

sda,Mar-16,"Tire input, please. At just under 54000 miles, the Goodyear Assurance Fuel Max are down to 5/32. I tend to replace around 4/32 to maintain good wet performance. Though I do not have any real complaints about the current tires, they certainly have gone the distance, I am wondering if I should try the Michelin Premier, Continental Contact V or Pirelli All Season Plus. All three were rated highly by Tire Rack and Consumer R. I do value a smooth quiet ride, good handling/traction, long life and maintaining good gas mileage. Thoughts?"

2016 Honda Civic: 182.3"" long, 70.8"" wide

1990 Honda Accord: c.185"" long, c.68"" wide

2013-2016 Accord: c.191"" long, c.73"" wide

2016 Mazda3: 180.3"" long, 70.7"" wide

And so the new Civic is close the size of an Accord from a quarter of a century ago. The Mazda3 and Civic are close in size—almost identical in width, with the Civic just 2 inches longer.

The Mazda3 is rated 34 mpg combined, while the new Civic is rated at 35 combined.

What's interesting is that if you go to the EPA mpg comparison site, it rates a 1990 Honda Accord with auto at 22 combined. If I'm calculating it right, that means that mpg for similar-sized cars has gone up by almost 60% since 1990...."
roadburner,Mar-16,"My 2 Series is the same size as an E36 3 Series and the current 3er is the size of an E34 5 Series. I prefer cars under 180"" in length and weighing 3500 pounds or less."
andres3,Mar-16,"roadburner said:

So that leads me to a question:

Would you prefer a 3,300 pound car that's a bit over 180"" long, let's say 183.5"" or something, or a 3,500 lb car that's 178"" long? I guess I'm asking which is more important to you, and why is length bad to you?"
nyccarguy,Mar-16,He'll take the lighter car
roadburner,Mar-16,Less weight is always better; as for preferring shorter vehicles- it's simple convenience; easier to maneuver and park.
andres3,Mar-16,"The reason I asked is because the new ""next"" S4 is supposed to be EVEN bigger than the current one (in my opinion it is already big enough). But I won't complain about the EXTRA size if it proves true they managed to increase size while reducing weight significantly (approx. 250 lbs). That being said, maybe they could have pushed 300 lbs lighter if they didn't make it even bigger."
akirby,Mar-16,Does 300 lbs make a real difference if you're not on a race track?
backy,Mar-16,"One way to find out: Take a drive of some length with no passengers or cargo. Keep track of speed and fuel economy. Then add people and/or cargo of 300 lbs and take the same drive, with conditions and speed as close to the original drive as possible. I'll bet the FE is lower on that trip than on the original trip.

There's a reason (CAFE) automakers are trying like h*** to shed weight on their vehicles. Ford for example just put a lot of money into their pickups to use lots of aluminum. They didn't do it because aluminum costs less than steel."
akirby,Mar-16,"Automakers deal in tenth of a mpg for CAFE. Owners wouldn't notice the difference. On the F150 it's just as much about payload capacity as mpg. Plus that was 700 lbs not 300.

Just saying it wouldn't be a drastic change that the average driver would even notice."
m6user,Mar-16,"If 300 lbs resulted in a 1 mpg difference that is substantial. I think you're talking about ride, handling and acceleration which may not be of much import to the average driver. Someone who really pushes their car and is acutely aware of performance would probably notice on or off the track."

I think the average driver will notice a difference with a weight reduction.  Look at the Ford F-150 with the Aluminum Body and 2.7 L Turbo V6 engine.  Now it doesn't deliver the drastic increase in real world fuel economy vs the previous year's steel bodied V8 F150 as one would expect with a 700 something pound weight loss.  Read the reviews.  Edmunds has one in their long term fleet. (Look at what owners (@henryn, @explorerx4) say.  The biggest plus is the everyday drivability of the new Aluminum body, Turbo V6 truck."
m6user,Mar-16,"I don't think any one thing results in what you call ""drastic"" fuel improvement. It's incremental mostly. Heck they all changed to electric steering and that resulted in maybe .5 mpg improvement at best. I really don't know what the average driver would notice as none of us here are probably in that category. Would they think their car handles a lot different with a heavy passenger riding with them? I doubt it but it's possible. None of us knows what the ""average driver"" feels, it's just a guess."
sda,Mar-16,"Thanks for the tire guidance. I will probably hold out until April-May. I believe that is when Michelin will have their sale.

I had the pleasure of going to the Atlanta car show. It was an impressive venue. Three cars really impressed me. The new Acura NSX looked stunning! Great job! The new Lincoln Continental looked better in person, very handsome, and somewhat imposing. The CTS-V, wow what a car!

I was able to drive round trip on a single tank of gas. Fuel light came on at 510 miles, range still read 74 miles left. Filled up about a mile from home, with 64 miles still showing. Right at 38 mpg, a/c on entire time, running 70-75 most of the way. This was in the Accord--made for a cheap trip!"

At the moment, I get 300-325 miles to a tank with my Elantra GT, and I'm averaging just under 28MPG in the 25 months I've had it. It's about 90% city driving, and the EPA sticker says 27 around town, so not too bad.I'd like the next car - whatever it is - to get more miles per tank so I'm not filling up every week."
suydam,Mar-16,It matters to me too.
nyccarguy,Mar-16,"@Michaell - the range matters more to me than the actual MPG.  I can get a full week's worth of driving on a tank.  My Legacy has a generously sized 18.5 gal gas tank.  I do think it should get better mpg due to its lackadaisical acceleration, but that's me.

Our Pilot barely gets 350 miles to a tank on the open highway.  A vehicle that size should be able to go a lot more on a tank.  Usually my wife gets maybe 250 - 275 gal to a tankful with her normal driving."
stickguy,Mar-16,"Or RDX is bad too with a 16 gallon tank. By 300 miles I'm getting antsy. 350 probably has me in full blown sweats.

That's a great thing about the Sonota. Big tank, good highway mpg. Often will fill up and TC resets to 500+. Good for trips to NC which is about 450 miles each way. We are going in May, but taking the Acura, so I know I have to stop midway to pump gas."
akirby,Mar-16,"A 1 mpg difference in a 16 gallon tank is only a 16 mile difference per tank.

I guarantee if you found a car you like you wouldn't worry whether it got 33 or 34 mpg highway."
m6user,Mar-16,"Please, I did not say that 1 mpg would change someone's vehicle choice unless everything else was equal which in car buying we all know isn't the case. I just said that manufacturers would consider any change that results in a 1 mpg savings as substantial. Add in other mpg saving methods and all of a sudden you get several mpg difference which helps in their cafe ratings and would affect sales positively."
stickguy,Mar-16,"More of an issue when you are getting 25!

This is a big advantage to most mid size cars vs. their compact siblings. Almost the same highway MPG real world, but 50% larger tank capacity."
suydam,Mar-16,"You get better MPG around town with the compacts, however."
stickguy,Mar-16,"Usually. But at least to me, the range around town is less than an issue, but accord to civic or Elantra to sonata, probably still at least a wash."
m6user,Mar-16,"@stickguy
Our RDX gets about 28-30 straight freeway driving. I bet if you filled up as you leave and drove conservatively you could make or come very close to making it. If you're driving at 75-80......forget it. If you could find some leaded gas I'm pretty sure you could make it easily. I bought a tank in northern Michigan once and couldn't believe what a difference it made."

If traffic is bad, might get 25 on the run. Usually I can hit 28ish. Still, too low for a 16 gallon tank!"
berri,Mar-16,"I dunno, if fuel economy was such an issue to most American buyers, why is it that the incentives are on the cars while many dealers lots can't keep many SUV's in stock? I think the importance of fuel economy for most ebbs and wanes based on gasoline prices. Most vehicles get decent mileage these days. I believe the gov increased the fuel consumption requirements in the last few years to appease their political base. Unfortunately, that is going to lead to price increases down the road because many of the lighter materials and applicable technology cost more to produce."
suydam,Mar-16,"I don't claim to speak for most buyers. I'm simply stating that it's important to me. And not just because of gas prices. I may not be in the majority, but I'm not the only one."

Michaell,Mar-16,"berri said:

IMO, it's because gas prices are low and folks have more disposable income to devote to gas, they'll gravitate to something that gets worse mileage - be it the V6 option, or a larger SUV rather than a 'cute ute'.

When gas prices get north of $3/gal again, all those folks will want to dump the (relative) gas guzzlers and move into hybrids or more fuel economy models, losing their shirts on the trade in the process.

Which is why I'm hoping gas prices stay low through the summer, so that when I'm back in the market there will be large incentives on the fuel sippers I'll be looking at."
andres3,Mar-16,"akirby said:

I've heard 100 lbs. can make a 1 MPG difference. Also, 300 lbs, will definitely increase your tire and brake wear rates.

My S4 eats tires and brakes like no other. Part of it is sheer speed, but part of it is all that freaking weight. Also, the spirited driver will notice 300 lbs easily when travelling winding roads. It just feels like more ""WORK"" to push a heavy Camaro through twisties than ""fun"" like a 3,300 lb car."

But mostly, if someone looks at 1 extra MPG, and sees that it gets 50 extra HP at the same time, that 1 MPG could make the difference in someone's purchase decision. It would be a combination of things.I know when choosing a V6 Accord over a 4 cylinder long ago I rationalized it as only 3 MPG, but I was gaining a lot of HP in exchange. It has to be taken in context. Lighter weight improves EVERYTHING."

 I suspect it is because people do not want ""pedestrian"" sedans and hatchbacks"
berri,Mar-16,"Those ""cute utes"" (I like that term!) are interesting. You have this reputation of practical and economical, yet our CRV really doesn't get that much different mileage than one of our kid's Highlander. Most difference in heavy traffic urban driving, but not all that huge. On the open highway sometimes the Highlander beats the CRV (maybe because a 4 banger is underpowered in fast, windy, or hilly road terrain given the higher profile of all SUV's creating more drag, along with extra awd weight?). To me, the biggest advantages to the CRV are it's smaller size is easier to maneuver and park, and it's lower price results in less out of pocket depreciation. Both are very good vehicles though."

backy,Mar-16,"I took in the Greater Twin Cities Auto Show today. It should be called the Lesser Twin Cities Auto Show as it wasn't deemed important enough to have the NSX on display. I focused on compacts as that's what I'm in the market for right now, to replace my 2013 Rio5 when it comes off lease if I don't buy it. But I checked out most of the mid-sized sedans, including the new Malibu (nice looking, and 22-32 mpg was really great for a mid-sized sedan... in 2010) and the Mazda6, which was in my favorite color, red. I really liked the updated interior, which IMO is now best-in-class. I figured I was sitting in at least a Touring trim, the interior was so nice. Also the car had sharp-looking alloys. When I got out and looked at the window sticker, I was shocked that it was the base trim! If I needed that big of a car I'd have it at the top of my list, with the Accord, Legacy, and Sonata right up there also.

Compact-wise, I was most impressed by the new Civic (sharp looking, improved interior, tons of legroom in back). The Jetta 1.4T is a nice package also with a huge rear seat and trunk and I'll bet there's deals to be had on those right now. The Elantra GT remains a favorite, but I'd go the used route on that since the 2016 base models have been decontented and I could get a certified 2014 with the 100k warranty."

Of course, you realized that was for the 2.0 T engine? 22-33 highway. Not bad for a car that will pull teeth. It's closely related to the 2.0 T in ATS, CTS, Camaro, and Regal. (LTG,259 hp and 295 lb-ft).

The standard engine, 1.6 Liter T, is 27 city and 37 highway, equal to the others. My '14 Malibu does about 4 over its highway rating on level interstate driving around our area so I'd extrapolate the 16 Malibu will do better than its 37 rating on level interstate at rated speeds."

Have improved greatly since that awful 2003 model I had and definitely would try one again if need be. Pricing seems to be very good especially with the rebates though I 'd prefer a SL model, the top of the line with the alloy wheels.

Fiat Chrysler cuts shift, idles 1,300 workers at Mich. car plant

April 6, 2016 - 1:08 pm ET
DETROIT (Reuters) -- Fiat Chrysler Automobiles is laying off about 1,300 workers indefinitely and ending one of the two shifts at its Sterling Heights, Mich., plant that makes the slow-selling midsize Chrysler 200 sedan.

U.S. sales of the Chrysler 200 dropped 63 percent in the first three months of this year from a year earlier, as FCA has de-emphasized sales of the model which had been often sold to rental agencies...."

benjaminh,Apr-16,"brian125 said:

Probably 20% of those are fleet sales, but yes it does look like the Altima is trying to pass the Accord for the #2 spot in midsize sales. I expect Honda to put up a fight with big sales incentives this summer—but not as big as what Nissan already has on the hood. Having driven both, I think the Accord is a much better car, but if you're on a budget the Altima seems good enough and costs probably $1000 less once incentives are taken into account."
stickguy,Apr-16,"I though Honda was production constrained, so couldn't really pass Camry (and I guess now Altima)?"
benjaminh,Apr-16,"stickguy said:

Honda can make up to c. 400k Accords a year for the US, which should be good for second place...if they can find the buyers. But it's true that Nissan can make as many as 450k Altimas, and Toyota can make as many as half a million Camrys. The reality is no one is quite selling at capacity in the midsize market. In fact, I heard a rumor that Honda is updating its huge Marysville factory to build SUVs in addition to Accords, TLXs and ILXs. I think that may have been an admission that they aren't likely to quite sell 400k Accords even in this good market."
ral2167,Apr-16,"The Accord loses sales due to its primitive lane watch system to help with blind spots, as opposed to the much better ""lights in the side mirrors"" that the camry/altima/mazda 6/fusion/any other car other than the accord uses."
andres3,Apr-16,I honestly wonder if lost sales for the Accord due to a Helen Keller option actually affects sales more than 0.1%?
benjaminh,Apr-16,"ral2167 said:

That's probably only make or break for a very small percentage of buyers. I think Honda's LaneWatch is better, but obviously that's just my opinion. The Accord has the best rear visibility of any midsize car on the market, and so unlike other midsize cars you don't really have ""blind"" spots. But I think we're never going to change each other's minds on this topic. The bottom line is that you can get a Camry, Altima, Sonata, etc. for a bit less than an Accord, which is probably for most people more important. But again, we'll just need to agree to disagree."
stickguy,Apr-16,"I doubt that matters. I agree that it is an inferior design, but the large majority of the big sellers (Altima and Camry) don't even come with BLIS. it is an option, and only on higher end models, and not all that common.

More likely is the Accord doesn't dump as many into rental pools, and tends to not have the same huge incentives, so price only shoppers move on."
brian125,Apr-16,"Agreed ...... Honda isn't losing many sales cause of its lane watch but they should put bliss on the drivers side mirror. Accord sales are being lost to other brands deeper discounts and fleet sales .

If I'm on a budget in the midsize market Camry , Altima , Sonata , Optima during certain months have much better incentives than Honda, Mazda6, and Fusion. Otherwise I agree with Ben Accord is better than most mentioned

stickguy,Apr-16,all the senior men heard that the young chicks found them sexy. that is all it took.
Mr_Shiftright,Apr-16,"Actually, the Altima is a pretty nice car. Of all the cars I've rented recently (admittedly, mostly economy stuff), I liked the Altima the best because it was completely lacking in personality --but didn't do anything really well or really badly. It was like the car's message was: ""Hey forget about me. Just drive"".

As the Edmunds review put it:

""Sporty handling isn't a priority for most family sedan buyers, obviously, so for the majority of drivers the Altima will be adequate, though not impressive. The ride quality isn't as smooth or composed over rougher pavement as rivals', but it's not overly harsh, either. Like many things about the 2016 Nissan Altima, it neither excels nor fails."""
stickguy,Apr-16,"I did test drive an altima a few years back (before I got the Hyundai). I seem to recall it being comfortable, and drove OK. it would have been more of a ""value buy"" but not a bad car and well equipped.

No clue if that impression would have changed with a longer drive including some highway. Driving around local doesn't tell you much."
Mr_Shiftright,Apr-16,"Yes, ""value buy"", that's it. The car is so utterly harmless it's hard to dislike it."
stickguy,Apr-16,"and for a large % of the driving population, that is perfect. Just needs to have some ""stuff"" on it."
benjaminh,Apr-16,"Mr_Shiftright said:

Hmmm. Well, I managed to dislike the Altima, although only mildly.

In terms of midsize rental cars I'd probably put it close to last. I think the Sonata is best midsize car that can be had as a common rental. Next for me is the Fusion. The Altima is about equal to the Camry to me, which isn't saying much. I guess the Altima beats the stuff from Chrysler?

I've never had an Optima as a rental car, but the new one is earning raves.

In terms of employment in the US when it comes to midsize cars, we have to take our hats off to the Japanese and the Koreans. The Camry factory in KY, the Altima factory in TN, the Accord factory in OH, the Sonata factory in AL, and the Optima factory in Georgia together provide quite a bit of good jobs."
Mr_Shiftright,Apr-16,"I find it hard to see vast differences in these cars. They are all pretty good. I bet it really comes down to the details---how you find the view out the back, seat comfort, whether you find this or that control annoying or easy---things like that. I don't think any of these cars push most people to the extremes of --""PLEASE get me out of here!"" or ""WOW!""

I have my preferences in the midsize range, but they aren't what I'd call strong preferences. I suppose I'd lean to the car with the best driving dynamics---the most fun, vs. perhaps comfort or gadgets."
andres3,Apr-16,"Mr_Shiftright said:

I found two things well below par on the , the engine, and the CVT transmission. Together they combine to make the car anemic and in order to move you don't get but maybe 2/3rd's the EPA estimate for fuel economy. However, if you are OK dawdling onto freeways, and don't care about slowness, it could make a decent car."

A colleague of mine recently considered many mid-size sedans for a new purchase to get out of an older falling apart V6 Pontiac.

It sounds like you're decided, but comparing the Mazda3 2.5 with the Civic Turbo AutoGuide got significantly higher mpg with the Civic....""On an identical run that included mixed city and interstate driving, we averaged 28.7 mpg in the Mazda and 36.2 mpg in the Civic, which is a huge difference.""http://www.autoguide.com/car-comparisons/2016-mazda3-vs-honda-civicAnd in terms of 0-60 times, Edmunds tested the Mazda3 2.5 at 7.5, while their test of the Civic turbo had a time of 6.7.But it's true there's nothing quite like a hatchback.

the type of tire makes a huge difference. Size is a factor, but even in the exact same size try driving on Bridgestone RE-71's and then switch to Continental Extreme Contact DW's and you'll immediately hear the difference! Both performance summer tires too. The Continentals also ride nicer."
Mr_Shiftright,Apr-16,I had the exact same experience switching from RE-71s to the Contis.
andres3,Apr-16,"Did your RE-71's also wear down like they were made of paper? Track people have spoken, the RE-11 might be 9/10's the performance, but you'll get 4X the track days out of them. Of course, I think this applies only to light track cars, not 2 ton speed demons (I weigh over 200 lbs) and the S4 doesn't drive itself.

I burned through both RE-11's and 71's quickly, but the 71's wore so quickly I had to track with questionable judgment on my part (starting to see visible cord)."
stickguy,Apr-16,"I already started planning for tires on the RDX (though at the pace we are putting on miles, might be another 2 years yet!). And pretty much nailed it down to Contis.

Now just have to deal with convincing the tire place to put on H instead of V (same load range) so I can get the ones I want."
Mr_Shiftright,Apr-16,I have to say it's possible the Bridgestones were a firmer sidewall but I still wouldn't go back to them.
benjaminh,Apr-16,"suydam said:

In the comparison by AutoGuide abov, they did say the Civic was quieter than the Mazda3. But they also say the 3 is more fun to drive.

""One of the first things you notice after driving both cars back to back is how much more refined the Civic feels. It drives smoother, it is a lot quieter inside, and it absorbs rough roads with much more grace. The Mazda, on the other hand, feels a bit rougher around the edges, and although it feels so much more connected to the road, comfort matters to a lot more people than performance....

If driving pleasure is what matters to you the most, get the Mazda3. Its engaging drive and the way it performs and just can’t be beat in its segment. The Mazda3 is also not the obvious choice, so if you like going against the grain, a Mazda will stand out, because I guarantee that you will see Civics everywhere.

But for everything else, the Honda Civic is the better all-around car. The Civic is a bit more expensive than the Mazda, but you get more features, better fuel economy, it’s more practical, and just feels more mature and refined, which really justifies the price premium.""

But actually, if you compare the turbo Civic EX-L (c.24k) to the Mazda 3 2.5 (c. 25k), it seems like the Honda is less expensive."

Sandman6472,Apr-16,"Drove both the Mazda3 and Civic at work this week. Both very nice though the interior of the Civic is a bit nicer and more techy. We owned a '05 Mazda 3s and loved the car as it was a blast to drive. We both considered a new 3 in late 2014 but the wife decided at the last minute to go with the A3 and since I had less to spend but wanted something similar, went with the Golf.
Seeing that you want a hatch, really love mine, go with the Mazda3 with the 2.5 engine and you'll be a very happy camper. Really in this comparo, giving the nod to the Mazda over the Civic! But think you'd enjoy either to be honest.

benjaminh,Apr-16,"For decades the Accord has outsold the Civic, year after year. One month isn't necessarily a trend, but in March 32,855 Civics were sold in the US, compared with 30,523 Accords. One reason is likely that the new Civic has grown so that it's the size of an Accord from the mid 1990s. For someone wanting a smaller but still ""midsize"" car, the Civic now fits the bill. And while the previous generation of Civic was somewhat underpowered and slow, the turbo Civic is now faster than a 4-cylinder Accord. Plus the Civic has not just adaptive cruise control, but full-stop adaptive cruise control, which is not available on the Accord, or even an Acura—at least as far as I know. So the Civic is getting not just some previous Accord buyers, but also even getting some trade-ins of Audis, etc. I personally don't want adaptive cruise control. I want to drive my own darn car! But I guess for some it's appealing...."
stickguy,Apr-16,"the Civic now has grown enough that it fits into that large compact/small mid size category that really works for me. The new elantra I think fits in there too, along with the Jetta.

will be interested to see what other options are out 1.5 years from now (geez, that puts us into MY 2018s)

Not sure how big the new Sube imprezza is though. It did look sharp (the concept car) at the auto show."
backy,Apr-16,"Now that the Midsize Sedans discussion has become the Compact Sedan & Hatch discussion I'll toss one in that doesn't get much attention: Forte. I got a Forte5 LX a few weeks ago to replace my off-lease Rio5. The other cars I narrowed down to were the Elantra GT (used, 2014), Mazda3 (also used, 2014), 2017 Elantra, 2016 Civic LX, 2016 Fit, and Jetta S 1.4T. My preference for a hatch put the Jetta, Elantra, and Civic at a disadvantage. What killed it for those cars was I wanted to get rid of the Rio5 painlessly and end up with low payments and nothing out of pocket, and VW, Honda, and Hyundai couldn't do a deal I liked. My Kia dealer gave me what I thought was a great deal on turning in the Rio5 two months early for the Forte5--nothing out of pocket, waived last two payments on the Rio5 (and I avoided paying for new tabs on the Rio5), and 35 payments of $185. It was a lot less payment-wise than buying the used Elantra GT or Mazda3. In fact it's costing me less per month than the Rio5 lease did, including a big reduction in insurance and some other savings.

The Forte5 doesn't handle as well as the Mazda3, but it has the same 173 hp 2.0L engine as the 2014+ Elantra GT, a comfortable, roomy, and nicely trimmed interior with lots of convenience features, and I like the styling. Also it's a very rare car... I've only seen one (in a parking lot) since I got my Forte5. (The sedans are more common.) EPA ratings aren't great, but I'm averaging 33-34 mpg overall so far (EPA 33 highway) which is only about 10% lower than I averaged, best case, with my Rio5. So I'm happy with it. I think it's worth a look for anyone looking for a compact hatchback."

I grabbed a flat-head screwdriver and pried it back open and went and bought some ghastly. Took it in and Kia service fixed it for no charge under the Warranty. Another problem was a mechanic saw that I needed a new radiator - the one in my Sportage 4X4 had a leak near the top. Fixed at no charge under Warranty. That was around the 15,000-mile mark.

Here's one thing that happened that was not covered by the Warranty. I was driving in mid-Missouri to one of our clinical training hospitals during college for my new Allied Healthcare career. It was early morning - suddenly the accelerator pedal pushed down too much, the radio went out and headlights grew dim. The SUV needed to be pulled over and shut down. Had it towed in - the alternator went out. They had to go looking for a new one and it got fixed the next day. Only time one of my 3 Kia's has stranded me. And the only time beside normal maintenance costs for any of the Kia's."
ab348,Apr-16,"Looked at the Kia Canada website last night. No deals to be had on anything I'd be interested in driving, but this might be the cheapest new car offer I've seen here in years:"
iluvmysephia1,Apr-16,"Whoa, ab348, as a Kia lover the ad posted there immediately caught my eye. The Forte is the latest iteration of my beloved 1999 Kia Sephia from whence I draw my Edmunds nickname. But this is from Canada - I thought of this immediately as a U.S. offer. I don't totally love the Forte 4-door sedan body style but kind of like it. I favor the Soul to this car but that offer totally rocks!"

Sandman6472,Apr-16,"We have some Forte hatches at work and folks seem to like 'em, a lot. I drove a new Sorrento the other day and I'd buy one in a second if we needed such a large vehicle. For years now, I've been super impressed with Hyundai/Kia and their products, they are like Honda was back in the 80's and 90's. Each new vehicle is better than the one it's replacing and their great warranty is just adding value. Am amazed whenever I drive my kids '08 Accent and then get into a newer Hyundai/Kia product at work and see how much improvement there is.
Think if I had bought a Kia Soul back in late 2013 instead of the Hyundai Tucson, I'd still have it in our fleet right now. Unfortunately, it was just too big for my needs...I am the only passenger 95% of the time and I put on about 13K miles each year and wanted something more economical. Will definitely be looking at Hyundai/Kia products the next time I purchase a vehicle which should be around the end of 2019. Am very lucky that my job at Hertz gets me behind the wheel of so many newer vehicles, never know what I'm going to drive at any given time. My lead drivers know I like Korean and German vehicles and if there is one to drive, they usually throw me the keys and tell me to have fun as they know I really really enjoy my gig with Hertz HLE!

backy,Apr-16,"iluvmysephia1 said:

The Forte5 LX comes standard with the 6AT. I would have preferred the 6-speed stick, especially if I could have gotten it for less than the AT, but the AT works well and I expect gives better FE than the stick.

One reason I went with the Forte5 vs. the Forte sedan is, for only about $400 more than the LX AT sedan, list price, there's a lot more standard equipment on the Forte5 including 16"" wheels, cruise, fog lamps, and lots of interior convenience features. Plus I like the versatility of the hatchback so it was a no-brainer.

I've driven the Soul before and it's a great car, but for some reason the deals offered by my dealer on the Forte were a lot better than on the Soul. And I do like the swoopy styling and interior of the Forte5. Ingress/egress isn't an issue for me, yet. I got an SUV for my wife last year because she needs the higher seating position."
iluvmysephia1,Apr-16,"Yikes, backy, it's literally been years since we've chatted. I like the Kia Forte5. A friend of ours took us for a ride in her late-model Forte5 in 2014 in Alamogordo, NM. I loved it! Quiet ride, man. Cool...this gives me more online perusing ta do regarding what might be our next rig..

backy, let me ask you a question. I drive a 2011 Kia Soul clear white base 5-speed. Wife loves it, I love it. She doesn't drive. We're always a one-car couple. How important is staying under Warranty to you? We bought two years of Powertrain Warranty on our Soul because we bought it used and we are the car's second owners. Anyhow, this extendo-Warranty ends on June 30, 2016.

I am thinking of doing 3 things. 1) Keeping our '11 Soul and going out of Warranty 2) Trading our Soul in on a new '16 Scion iA sedan in 6-speed MT form and Stealth color. Even though black isn't a color 3) Trading our Soul in on a new Kia Soul. What do you think of the new iA from Scion? Essentially a 2016 Mazda 2 sedan with Scion badges and a very strange gaping maw in the front that has grown on me. And I don't need surgery to remove it. Just joshin'.

Any opinion on this scenario? I don't have to do a thing - could just drive, maintain and enjoy our current Soul. Financially I can go either of the three routes and feel good about sleeping after possibly making a deal. The Mrs. would balk at trading but she always does. We wouldn't be mortgaging the Chow Chow's education ta try and make the payments in either of the two purchase scenarios. The current Soul has a comfortable note going on payments and a dealer would have to value our trade fairly for it to be agreeable to me or I'd walk out. 

Just interested mostly in what you think or know about the iA, soon to turn in to the 2017 Toyota Yaris iA? Some online personalities are saying buy the Scion, don't wait till it becomes a Toyota because Toyota will mark it up and break up its feature content by making separate models of iA - thereby maximizing their profits. I tend to agree. There's one in Denver selling for only $14,395. Discounted $2,100 by the dealer already. They have 12 iA's in stock and this is the only manual trannied one. That is really a good deal for the amount of car and features you get. Accident avoidance, pushbutton start, 7"" entertainment screen, backup camera, Mazda driving fun with the 6-speed and so on. If they want to sell (they're shutting down Scion so their dealer's going bye-bye...so they want to sell) and have a good vibe and I love the car in a test drive, I would go for it. If they want more down than I want to put down and get all grabby I would shut it down and putter away in my '11. Thoughts?"
stickguy,Apr-16,"My. $.02. Would not bother me at all to go out of warranty on your current soul. Miles aren't that high, and it is a simple car. If you are worried enough to fork out for another warranty, better off putting that money toward a new car.

Of the other 2, the soul is much more car, and in my world, way better as an only car. Plus buying new, you get all 10 years of coverage.

If you are only looking at keeping the 2011 a few more years, and will be paying on it all that time, might as well trade now since you will never be out of payments anyway. Plus who knows how much longer the stick will even be available in a soul."
iluvmysephia1,Apr-16,"Yep - we've paid 1 1/2 years of our Soul's payments and have 3 1/2 years still to pay. Trade-in value should be close but doubtful as much as amount owed on the car. Probably $1,500 or so under. Would catch up in another year and a half, estimated. The Mrs. would say nay, for sure. The Soul's ingress and egress/driving position is hard to beat and it is tightly put together. No rattles, fair acceleration and not a load of cabin noise. It is sound and fun to drive.

Lately I've read the iA's back seat is cramped - would want to sit back there on the test drive to verify. I don't like that and the Soul has room in the back for passengers. And Chow Chow's and Pomeranian's."
Michaell,Apr-16,"iluvmysephia1 said:

I stopped in at a local Toyota / Scion dealer yesterday and looked over the iA. Full report over in CCBA.

But, I will confirm, the back seat is pretty tiny. I couldn't 'sit behind myself', as they say. But, given that it's only me in the car 98% of the time, it's not a big deal. We've got the Outback for family duty."

Yep - and with me, it's usually just myself or the Mrs. and myself. Possibly a couple of canines in the back or some groceries in the hatch and/or the back seat. So the iA isn't scratched because of tight quarters back there, it's just not stacking up to it's Soul competition. Hee-hee, pardon the pun!"
backy,Apr-16,"iluvmysephia1 said:

I like having a warranty, and that's one reason I lease cars vs. buy used when I can get a great lease deal--as I've done in recent years on a Sentra, my Rio5 and Forte5, and my wife's 2013 Sonata. But I bought her 2012 CX-7 because it was a great price ($13.5k), great condition, low miles, and has a lifetime powertrain warranty. But my daughter's 2008 Mazda6 has no warranty, and it's held up well the 2 years I've owned it. Needed a new battery and some other maintenance an 8-year-old car with 120k miles needs, but I found a low-cost mechanic that keeps those costs down.

I've read some very positive reviews on the Scion iA. Looks like it would be a really fun car to drive, especially with the 6MT. The show-stopper for me would be that front end. Uggggg-ly! Otherwise I wouldn't mind driving it at all. But I do appreciate the additional room, smoothness, and power of my Forte5 compared to my Rio5, which is about the same size as the iA. I expect the iA is a more solid car than the Rio5 though."
akirby,Apr-16,Paying $4K to replace an engine in one year is still far cheaper than a $500/mo lease. And you're not going to pay that much every year. So don't fool yourself into thinking it's cheaper to lease or buy new. It almost never is. It can be a lot more fun and a lot more convenient though.
roadburner,Apr-16,"akirby said:

I agree 100%. People will have a couple of $500 repairs and use that as an excuse to buy a new car and take on a $6000/year(or more) financial obligation. If you like the new car smell and/or owning the latest and greatest just admit it. There's nothing wrong with that- you just cant make a financial case for doing it."
iluvmysephia1,Apr-16,"roadburner - that's right, and I really fall in to that category.... it's not the new car smell, either. It's the new ""toy"" thing, unfortunately, even with liking the lower end rigs as I do, that can be an expensive endeavour. Funny, the Mrs. totally gets that."
backy,Apr-16,"akirby said:

LOL! I'd never lease a car for $500/month or anywhere close to that. My last four leases have been $175/month (2010 Sentra), $47/month (with a trade, roughly $210/month w/o for 2013 Sonata), $170/month (2013 Rio5 LX AT PP), and $185/month (2016 Forte5 LX). All with nothing up front except I did make the first payment up front on the Sentra, but they also threw in a free nav system and portable DVD player. If I can't find a great lease deal, I buy used. The last car I bought new was a 2004 Elantra GT, paid $13.2k for a $17.4k car. One of my sisters still owns it. The most I've ever paid to buy ANY car, new or used, is $13.5k, which is what my wife's 2012 CX-7 cost last fall."
akirby,Apr-16,Point still remains that it is cheaper to keep a paid off vehicle and do repairs than it is to buy or lease a new vehicle. Claiming otherwise is just fooling yourself.
andres3,Apr-16,"akirby said:

Unless you buy something that falls apart right after the warranty..............

Hi Chrysler!"
akirby,Apr-16,Possible but rare that you'd have to spend more than $2K per year on repairs every year on a modern vehicle. Even a Chrysler......
Sandman6472,Apr-16,"Stay the course right now seems to be the theme here. Kia's are pretty reliable and doubt you'll have any problems as long as you stay current on the oil changes/tire rotations and follow the maintenance schedule in the manual. Hell, our '08 Accent is still going strong at 26K even though I had to put new sneakers on it last May. Daughter will be driving more once she passes her boards and gets a full time job come the fall. And in her case, if she needs a new vehicle, it would fall on us to pay for it, something not gonna happen!
But in your case, keep what ya got at least for another year or two. Set your sights on a late 2017/early 2018 model.

My gosh, how long can the Corolla keep it's sails (and sales) filled with reliability lore from the past. Next time you see one and are bored (like on the Metro, Bus, stuck in traffic, etc) look at it carefully. The only styling cue that is modern at ALL is the front clip, After that, it is straight up (Yawn) 4 door compact(ish) sedan. It has LED headlights. Woo Hoo. However, I can't deny the numbers.

The new Civic is BAD A**. What a leap for Honda. I don't know if it is a 17 or 16 but the new Civic looks like it has thrusters for taillights, Just wild for Honda. Heck just wild period. I kept waiting for boosters to kick in and those taillights to light superbright, and in a blink of an eye it's gone.

My BFF has a 2015 Si stick shift with the big rims (18's??) and let me run some errands in it while he took a nap.BTW he is making mad money moonlighting on UBER..I can't say it was as ""on rails"" as the 1999 Integra V-TECH (200 HP) but it came darn close. I think the difference is the electric power steering and the tires, which, NO ONE will notice after driving it for 3 days. It was the 6 speed, and it felt like 0-60 mph at about 6.7 seconds. His car only has 2100 miles on it so I didn't want to break it trying to get a number I can't even clock scientifically.

Now, how does everyone else except Mazda get the recipe' wrong when they have an almost perfect handling larger compact like the Civic to tear apart and learn from?

Things that make you go hmm....

I still love my PAID FOR 2012 Optima. Just wish my car was kept the same and shoehorned the 2.3 EcoTurbo from the Mustang in it along with the manual trans. However, my baby still looks good after 5 years outside.

Your opinion and you are entitled to it. My thoughts on Kia is - I didn't pull myself up from the depths of poverty to drive a Kia.  I seriously wouldn't drive a Kia if I got a free one.  Just my opinion, and everyone is entitled to theirs"

But I think they've made huge strides since then, and now I wouldn't mind driving several of Kia's models. And I have a Forte5 now.

I noticed the other day that CR has a Kia as their top pick in mid-sized SUVs, two Kias on their list of best new cars under $25k, a Kia with the highest score (tie) for large cars, and Kia overall tied with Toyota , and ahead of Honda (!), Mercedes-Benz, VW, Ford, Acura, Chevy, Nissan, Infiniti, Cadillac and many others.

I've owned a couple of Hondas and a couple Toyotas but never a Hyundai or kia. I currently own an acura. Before going with him I told him he couldn't go wrong with Honda or Toyota. After going with him and riding/driving each of those cars, I would rank those cars in this order: optima, sonata, accord and camry."

wayne21,May-16,"The optima and sonata were incredibly quiet and smooth and the cars had very good feels when driving. They were solid driving machines. The interior layout seemed to be well thought out and functional. They had some features that my ""top of the line acura"" doesn't have even as an option. The interiors were nicer than the accord or camry. The accord suffered from the classic Honda product wind noise (not sure if Honda doesn't know how to prevent this after years and years of wind noise or if people will buy their products anyway so they don't care). I thought some of their electronics left a lot to be desired and I didn't think much of the layout of their controls. I thought some of the materials in the accord were pretty cheap, too. The camry was pretty quiet, but there was little to no feel to the driving experience and it had the cheapest of all the interiors. In fact, I'd say the camry was an econobox when compared to the other vehicles. Just one opinion and I didn't have a nickel in it one way or the other."

Have your friend check out the Subaru Legacy very nice ride with rave reviews all around but underpowered motor. Probably wont matter much if a 4cyl is your friends choice.

The Mazda 6 does handle better than the 4 vehicles you mentioned but what I noticed when I test drove the Mazda 6 was to much road noise, worse than the Accord. Mazda6 ingress / egress is terrible for anybody close to 6'. its smaller contoured cock pit and awful front seating gets 2 thumps down.

For the average Joe the 2016 Sonata is a great family hauler with above tech and safety features. For a sharper sportier look the Optima is right there."
akirby,May-16,Would be interested to hear how the Fusion stacks up against those.
sda,May-16,"I had the opportunity to drive a new 16 Fusion SE 2.0 recently. I really liked how it drove, good ride and handling, quiet, comfortable handsome interior and good zip from the 2.0 ecoboost. Only thing I didn't really care for is the reduced visibility looking out of the car. The windshield pillar is fairly large, and it is a little hard to see out the back, but nothing like the HHR that I had some years ago."

Thought's on 2013 Accord........... VS........... 2016 Fusion . Ride , Handling, Size, Refinement, features, visibility, layout ?

Your EX Accord is a 4cyl. Thoughts comparing to Fords 2.0"
zandor,May-16,"Ford's 2.0L EcoBoost is a turbo engine, and it's quite a bit more powerful than the naturally aspirated 4-cyl in the Accord. 2.0L EcoBoost v. Accord V6 would be a more appropriate comparison."

Funny thing. On the weekend an acquaintance was test-driving midsize cars and one of the choices was the Fusion SE. He absolutely hated it, especially the seats. He liked the new Malibu quite a bit but had reservations about the 1.5 turbo engine."
sda,May-16,"brian125 said:

I do have an EX and it has been one of the best cars I've owned. I wanted to drive a Titanium but they didn't have one. This was a loaded SE with everything except AWD and sunroof. So it had a richer feel inside, I think mainly because of the leather, which had a nice look and feel. The interior felt snug compared to the Accord, and as I mentioned visibility out was not as good either. Had good door mirrors and back up camera, so that helped. Good feature content. Memory and heated seats, upgraded audio, etc. Though it didn't feel overwhelmingly more powerful than the Accord, it did have a little more kick when you jumped on the pedal. There is something about a turbo in that they feel like they have an endless amount of torque which makes acceleration seem effortless. I prefer the traditional feel of the Fusion's 6 speed auto over the Accord's CVT, however the CVT is great when driving up and down hills, grades on the highway. It never hunts for gears, just modestly and seemlessly adjusts engine revs to maintain driving speed. The Fusion had a more supple ride, less stiff, but still firm. It was quieter as well. At highway speeds there was faint wind and tire noise. In the Accord I hear more pronounced wind noise around the driver's window and depending upon road surface, road noise."

Why not? People replace their phones every 6 months for a new phone that has maybe 2 new features. I saw an ad on Cable (Yes, I am a Settler, LMAO) for X' new phone that a motorcyclist was using as his Speedometer/HUD,
OMG... I have been doing that for 2 years on my Galaxy s3.I just mount it on my Optima's windshield in any color I want and it has a lot of great features like blinking when I go over whatever limit I set-up and set which color and font size for it to flash. I have not had a ticket since I have been using it, and not having to take my eyes off the road is priceless. HUD displays should be standard on all cars.

back to the stupid keep-up-with-the-Johnsons-phone. I have many times compared it to thee new ones and the core features have not changed at all. 99% of new phones still have 16gig internal memory and 2 gigs ram. So does my 4-5 year old phone. It is no thicker than the newer ones....and a wider one would not fit my custom car windshield bracket (so it doesn't bounce around....it stays dead still, even on a gravel road), or fit in my cell phone jacket pocket as well. All the while iPad/Surface touchscreen type dealy sales are down 30%. I used to take mine to church so I could use bible app, but my phone is much easier to carry and has the same thing.

Sorry to go off topic a bit here....but it applies to cars. I don't need a new car or a need new cell phone.Those are want's. I need food, gas, clothing and to financially support 3 daughters, Then on to A/C fliters changed, gutters cleaned and home pest inspections and pet checkups....not another car payment or $400 cell phone purchase bill. ,,,,and while I am ranting, if you live in the city, almost any cell carrier will work fine.

I drove the 2015 Mazda6. It had leather but I forgot the the trim. I think it was the middle option called Touring..like mine. Ingress and egress were so comparable to my Optima that I failed to notice. It had a loud intake growl at low RPM's and at those speeds was quicker than mine...until about 60. Both being Automatics, 2.4 to 2.5liter's (same size pretty much except on paper), and both being the same color with the same options, I would have a heck of a time choosing,.... except when it came to the back seat and the quality of the interior trim. On the things you can't see....handling, zoom zoom, whatever..it had a stiffer ride and was less comfortable; but it turned and steered waaaay better than mine. Still, my trans is smoother, I have more power at higher RPM's, and a far longer warranty. Looks wise, my kids said ""It looks just like your's daddy"". They are pretty much right."

stickguy,May-16,"I am curious to see what trim levels come out next year on the turbo Civic with a stickshift. They have said there will be some. Hopefully not just like the base engine, and only on a strippo version.

the other problem (and I don't think this is just a Honda issue) is the fancy nanny tech doesn't work with the stick. specifically, the auto brake stuff you can't get (and that is bundled with all the other bits and pieces).

and of course, Honda somehow decided that if you want a stick, it can only come in black/black or gray/black.

I did not find the Accord CVT to be a bother when I test drove them, but have never tried it in a civic. Next year, definitely on the list to try!"
zandor,May-16,"CVT just feels different. It works just fine; some people just don't like change. I drove a Dodge Caliber with a CVT (rental car) back in 2008. So CVT + 8 years ago + POS model. The CVT felt different, but it was no problem. No way I'd ever buy a Caliber though. Old people who don't like change are the least of the Caliber's problems."
benjaminh,May-16,"One vehicle that fits into the compact/midsize segment is the VW Golf. It's really a whole family of cars that includes the Golf, Golf Sportwagen, GTI, e-Golf, and Golf R. As we know, the ""midsize"" category according to the EPA means a vehicle needs to have total combined cargo and passenger room of 110 cubic feet. Total US sales last month for the whole Golf family came to 5108, down 7% from last year.

The standard 4-door Golf has passenger room of 93.5, and then has a comparatively huge 22.8 cargo area (a big increase from the last generation). The list price for the base model with the auto transmission is a fairly reasonable $21,275. The Golf 4-door is 167.5 inches long, compared to 182.3 inches for a Civic. But the Golf is rated 29 mpg combined, compared to 35 for a Civic. Even at today's low gas prices that comes to about $200 a year.

VW plans to come out in the next year or so with a more advanced 1.5 turbo, which should be able to match the mpg of the current Civic turbo.

Sales of the regular (non-GTI etc.) Golf have been weak this year. Only 1,104 regular Golfs were sold last month, a decline of 36% from last year. This year Honda will sell probably almost 400,000 Civics, but at the current rate VW will sell less than 15,000 Golfs this year. The Jetta is maybe a closer comparison, and they'll probably sell c. 120,000 or so Jettas this year.

The Golf to me has a certain cache just because it is so rare.....Although the model I like best is the Golf Sportwagen. 1,012 new Sportwagens found new homes last month, a decline in sales of 17% from last year."

Looks bad now, but it will blow over rather quickly I expect.

The latter included all kinds of Fomoco vehicles including trucks, but annual sales didn't really get all that affected. Americans tend to have short memory focus."

Funny, those incidents do not affect my opinions of Ford as much as does the experience of people I know with recent Ford models.

Ford continues to use some cheap-looking interior materials, which makes me wonder about the quality of things I cannot see."
akirby,May-16,Explorers were no more prone to rollovers than other vehicles. But I'm sure we can't have a logical discussion about the facts.

m6user,May-16,"My point was Ford got slapped and learned their lesson just like other manufacturers have for major problems. Don't be so defensive as it was well known that Explorers were more prone to rollover than others. I've owned several Fords and had pretty good,luck with them. My first car was a Falcon. I also had a 68 Mustang and a 1973 Pinto. Luckily I didn't get rear ended in the Pinto and it was my last stick shift. Pretty much drove GM through the 80s and 90s.
I would have no problem buying a Ford now but I just don't care for the interiors and the infotainment systems and controls. Exterior styling on the Fusion ranks just one notch below the Mazda6 IMO."
berri,May-16,"I think it is feasible to argue that GM is on the way to passing Ford up again on everything but maybe pick up trucks. Ford is ahead on turbo's, but they seem to consume too much fuel compared to competitors. Actually, Ford seems to be lagging in overall drivetrains compared to the competition whether turbo or conventional (trannies and engines). Ford used to lead in seating and interiors, but not so much today. Ford was an initial leader in cockpit electronics, but My Ford/Synch seems to have fallen behind some other alternative makes. It seems like I'm reading and hearing more and more quality complaints regarding Ford vehicles recently. Maybe they need to get Mulally back involved because to me at least, they seem to be devolving from the gains they recently made in product leadership. Sure profit is up, but the market in general is in an up stage. What happens next downturn? And don't forget that in the not too recent past too much cost cutting got Detroit in trouble after some high profits from it initially."
ab348,May-16,"berri said:

I would argue that Ford never led in interiors. Even going back to the 1960s, Ford interiors were always behind those of others, while more recently even Bill Ford admitted that their philosophy was more about making interiors ""cheap and cheerful"" than anything else. As for Sync, it was so bad early on that they had to apologize and promise to make it better. By the time they did that, others had passed them by."
akirby,May-16,Explorers were LESS prone to rollover than Chevy Blazers. The government even concluded that in their testing in 2001. Ford had some blame with tire pressures - it's not worth debating more than that. People win lawsuits against companies because juries are sympathetic not because of the facts. In 2005 a drunk driver lost control and rolled an explorer ejecting the passengers who weren't wearing seatbelts. Ford lost a $31M lawsuit because they didn't use laminated safety glass in the doors that the plaintiffs claim would have kept them in the vehicle. Ridiculous.
akirby,May-16,"Ford has great engines from a performance standpoint - fuel consumption is still not stellar. And if you haven't looked at a Ford interior lately (especially a Titanium) I think you'll be surprised. However, interiors are completely subjective and mostly personal preference once you get past basic material quality."

ab348,May-16,"stickguy said:

Odd thing with automotive cloth. Ued to be that cloth was standard in most models, and as you went up the scale in models it was better quality cloth with better stitching patterns and ornamentation. Somewhere along the way that seemed to go away and we are left with either mouse fur fuzzy cloth or burlap. Part of the problem is, I suppose, the lack of color choices offered now as opposed to back then. A nice blue or green or red cloth interior could look very pretty. It is hard to make a dark gray or black burlap interior look good. There is nothing inherently wrong with a cloth interior done correctly. It is just that very few automakers do that."

So the Focus was taken off the short list.
Tried the Jetta but it was a bit too large for the garage but the Golf fit perfectly. Consider the Golf as the poor mans Audi A3 and they are very similar. Luckily I get to drive a 2015 A3 as the wife picked up one about a week before I bought the Golf. We are both happy with our choices!

Sandman6472,May-16,"Just want to give out a warning to folks looking at the Ford Fusion. There is a definite problem with many of the new ones where the vehicle will go into limp mode with no warning and this is a real dangerous safety hazard. It has happened to me and a couple other co-workers at work. I work for Hertz HLE, a direct competitor of Enterprise. We have a mess of the new Fusions and this is a known issue though Ford will not admit it. In the last two weeks, we have had five new Fusions exhibit this dangerous condition and believe me, it's scary. Happened to me twice now while driving on the Florida turnpike. Funny thing was we were taking them all to our location at the Pines Ford location in Hollywood Florida. The dealer fixed them under warranty but has still yet to admit to the problem or what is causing it.
The vehicle drives fine but within 5 or so minutes, both of the ones I drove went into limp mode. one has to turn the vehicle off and sit for a few minutes. Starts up again and acts fine but within minutes, the same thing happens with it going into limp mode and then having to shut the thing down. Very unnerving and a real safety hazard. One of my co-workers refuses to drive any Fusion and I am a bit unhappy if I do have to drive one. It has also happened to another co-worker in the Lincoln MKX so something isn't right here. Just hope Ford fixes this issue before someone gets seriously hurt or even killed.
Between the awful auto tranny in the Ford Focus and the engine problem with the Ford Fusion and Lincoln MKX, no way would I ever think to purchase a Ford product. Since I have felt this issue first hand twice now, just want others to beware of this serious issue!

Wow, I could not have said it better myself! Also the fact that you drive many, many makes and models puts you in a position as working in the auto industry, and qualified to know what sounds and drives like crap, and what does not. Also, you get a feel for what is going to hold up over time and what probably will not.

My 2012 Optima EX still drives like new, helped me steer around a certain death accident that developed right in front of me. (Missed by 1"" with the help of stability control and ABS). Also after 4.3 years there is a little chipped clearcoat on the hood where it meets the front clip, and the drivers side headlight has fog/small amount of water in it and some damage I caused adding/ removing some smoked headlight covers. I bought a whole new headlight assembly for $99.00 including shipping, where to my surprise I saw the original invoice for $650!! Other than that the high pressure fuel injection hose, and high pressure A/C hose both got a hole in them and were replaced under warranty. Neither caused me to have to call a tow truck, and I had received recalls on both. The A/C line had dye injected in the freon so they found the leak exactly where the TSB said it would be, I took the car in a week after the 2nd recall notice was received and another type of dye was injected in the high pressure hose but it died a week later. What I could not believe was that it still ran on the 2nd and previously unknown low pressure hose, so I was able to safely and slowly drive to the dealer and have the high pressure hose replaced. This happened at 41k and prior to these two problems (both at roughly the same time) absolutely nothing broke on the car. I still love it.

BTW: The new Civic looks great, especially at night when all four Tie-Fighter light bars are on. I like the back of the restyled Accord but the front gets a zero. Class over Plastichrome Honda. Do you see a bunch of Plastichrome on Audi's and BMW's? Even if it is only a mid cycle re-style?

Lastly: You are right about Ford. They have the worst quality record of all Trucks, large sedans, and the Focus/Escape do not have a good reliability record. Period. (Consumer reports)"

Considering the fact that Toyota has had many more years to work on the Camry, I am proud of the Optima'a accomplishments but mainly the handling is still not taken seriously as ""well sorted"" by almost 100% of major mag reviews. I don't know about the Camry owners, but mine feels ""well sorted"" while it walks away from Camry SE (4 cyl) in almost any real life situation(s) I have come across.Nuff said."

This would seem to fall in line with complaints on the web about Ford quality declining. I think Mark Fields and the Ford family need to cut back on the Jacques Nasser II digression into things like self driving car technology and bring focus back onto current product. Might need to put Mullaly on the board of directors or something to get Ford back into focus and on track with current product, as well as avoiding the predictable down the road sell-offs of these digressions at losses. Maybe Ford stockholders need to rethink these Ford family super shares at the next board meeting if Bill Ford can't get a better grip on his CEO and company? Didn't Nasser have some initial profit gains before his grand plan of acquisitions almost brought the company down? The Ford family sure seemed to go along with his grandiose plans and schemes far too long."
akirby,May-16,"Ford has had a series of bad parts including fuel tanks, throttle bodies, etc. Hard to tell if they're squeezing suppliers too much or if they lost too many experienced engineers when they downsized in 2007 or it's a lack of quality control. Some of it is due to all the platform changes to consolidate multiple global platforms. With record profits and platform work behind them they need to do better going forward.

That said I just bought a new Lincoln MKX and its flawless."

I honestly couldn't think of a nice thing to say about it other than it taught me never to take another one. It was truly a piece of crap. After returning home I checked on the verano and it was advertised as a small ""luxury"" car. I found that to be totally laughable. It was nothing but a cheap chevy cruze with a buick label on it."

Subaru legacy has to step up its game also with better Tech and upgraded motor to stay competitive in a few years.

Ford has seemed to spring ahead in these area's but needs to offer the Tech/ safety features in the lower models. Thought I read some where that by 2020 all car models should be offering upgraded Tech and safety features in all models.

Back in 1984 my future wife wanted a new Accord. It was during the ""voluntary import quotas"". Accords were the hot ticket and every Cincinnati Honda dealer we visited tried to pull some sort of scam.

andres3,May-16,"I wish we could have kept my '03 Accord Coupe V6 LX in the family. I had a pending sale with my brother in law scheduled, but his sister-in-law (from another family than mine) somehow gave him horrible advice and got him to overspend on a brand new Altima 4-cylinder sedan, rather than get my 4 year old 60K mile Accord for a great price.

I am certain that Honda had many trouble-free miles left in it; certain enough I would have personally warranted it to 100K miles without a second thought or worry. He doesn't really have the money or savings to be buying brand new cars in my opinion.

He bought every conceivable add-on waste the dealer was selling (GAP, gap for gap, extended warranty, and who knows what in God's Earth else), and of course ended up totaling that Altima a few years (3) later so he got zero value from all that crappy expensive add-on stuff dealers like to sell. Thank goodness Geico treated him well on the value. Then he got a 1 year old at the time 20K mile '09 Mazda 6 base model 4 banger that he still has beating around.

How a young single man would rather have a low power 4-banger Altima Sedan than a V6 Accord Coupe is beyond me. I ended up putting it back on the market and got $250 more than I was going to sell it to him months and a few K miles earlier."

andres3,May-16,"So if I wanted the cheapest mid-size sedan lease money can buy, instead of getting a lower cost used car, what would be my best bet? I see Honda advertising Accords for $189/mo. I know I've received VW e-mails about Passats going for $99/mo, but that probably has a huge upfront fee. Never leased before, so could use all the help I can get to determine the best value for me. I saw something on Edmunds where it looked like the 3 year 36,000 mile total cost was somewhere in the neighborhood of $9,000 dollars. I'm a bottom line kind of guy and I think that makes it easiest to determine what the best deal is between apples and oranges. Might not be a terrible way to go and have a new daily driver car instead of an old beater. I'd probably only need 10K miles per year actually as my mileage may drop significantly with a new location for my job soon; being much less of a commute, and I'd probably still want to drive the Audi at least one day per week to work to keep it fresh and in shape, in addition to weekend fun use. I could easily adjust my mileage up or down by changing the split between my ""future/theoretical"" 2 cars for my use garage from 3/4 to 4/3 per week and vice versa! Being able to own and use 2 cars is great! Worst thing about it is the insurance costs."

Some good lease midsize deals with 1st month, dealer doc fee and maybe out of pocket taxes paid up front are Altima , Sonata , Camry. 3/36k . $169, 179, $189 month.

Lease prices have regional incentives check your state. I know here in NY I could lease a Altima for $169 month 3/36 with 1k out of pocket for above mentioned expenses. Every 1000 dollars you knock off vehicle price will save you around 30 dollars a month on a lease.

Drive it through the summer.  Wait until your job changes before you rush into something.  I personally don't thinknit would be worth the extra expense ""just to keep the miles off the TTS.""

You our are on the right track by looking at the total cost of the lease instead of just the monthly payment.  

Edmunds has a whole list of $199/month lease deals every month."

In 3yrs throw the keys back at the dealer with front end wear and tear, worn brakes , rotors, wiper blades and hopefully tires."
andres3,May-16,"nyccarguy said:

I agree with you, no rash decisions. The job isn't changing per say, just the location I'm working from or out of daily (to be much improved and much closer to home, but still a commute of probably 20-30 minutes).

I don't know about waiting the WHOLE summer though However, we will definitely wait until all the diesel-gate $5K giveaway details are hatched out; which is supposed to be finalized by the end of June I believe. That will be the minimum wait period to hatch this all out. If anyone deserves the full reported $5K (or more), it'll be owners of nearly new '15 TDI's.

It wouldn't be to just keep miles off the TTS, it would be to have a more convenient family hauler (including occasional visitors including family/friends), and vacation road tripper option other than my wife's wagon being the only choice for that stuff. Although I think the TTS would be a fun road tripper; at least for the driver!

It would also allow me to go with a more extreme tire setup, such as Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2's become feasible, whereas if it is a daily driver, it has got to be just the Super Sports to be more livable day to day. I've been dreaming of drastically overspending on some forged 19"" wheels that I've been eyeing for awhile that would look and be great for the car, which would be perfect lightweight wheels for extra fun track use, and make the car a serious force to be reckoned with on the track (not that it already isn't). Also would allow me to not worry about swapping wheels/tires out for track weekends like many do (I don't like the hassle of running a mobile tire shop). Not planning on ever buying a truck/SUV and trailer to haul the TTS above ground either. EDIT: We'll, what's a Forester XT's towing capacity? Guess I should consider all options How much does a trailer bed for a car cost?

In other words, by becoming more of a toy, it can become more focused like a TT-RS. More customization; but really, a stage 1 tune and lighter weight 19"" wheels is all I see this car needing since it came with beautiful but huge 20 inchers. Impossible to find detailed specs on OEM wheels, but I saw someone online report the forged Audi 20"" wheels are 4 pounds lighter each as compared to the regular OEM 19"". Only problem I foresee is that 20"" tires cost about 25% more than 19"" tires. That doesn't come close to justifying the expense of forged 19"" wheels, but it doesn't hurt The lifespans of the tire sets on a properly driven TTS should be pretty short.

Where was I when they launched this car? I'm an Audi guy and even I didn't hear about it or this car until about 2 months ago at the earliest; which was way too late for a Launch Edition TTS. They really haven't been marketing it at all. What I missed out on was the ""Launch Edition"" package which came with the red interior, forged performance oriented 19"" wheels, and much more for a bargain price of $6K. I think you had to get pearl or metallic black exterior though (too hot for CA), but still a steal of a deal at the price. You don't get registration fees refunded in CA, so I suppose I got nearly 1/2 of my yearly money's worth by waiting until the last day of April to trade in the S4."

Every Honda and toyota clearly had a second sticker that listed every imaginable thing they could add (at high prices) and added something like added market value or additional dealer profit to that sticker. All in all they added a couple thousand dollars to the price of a 6 or 7,000 car. I opted to go the Chrysler route and buy a K-car (one of Lee Iacocca's cars - not as bad as the Pinto he was responsible for, but not much to write home about either).

ab348,Jun-16,"The ATS is getting serviced today so I was given a new Malibu as a rental/loaner. It is a LT model so pretty representative of the bulk of them I suppose.

Lots of room inside, but the cloth upholstery is pretty burlap-ish. They do have two patterns of cloth, a plain black weave along with a patterned black with gray material. That last type also makes an appearance on the dash, which I am less than crazy about but whatever. The dash materials are not hard plastic but a rubberish material that gives a little when touched. There is a huge mostly flat area between the dash and the base of the windshield. Pillars are thick but that is par for the course these days. Rear visibility not great. Dash design probably better than the previous generation but it seems almost Chrysler-like to me somehow. Not a huge fan.

Trunk is a decent size but if there is an interior release button I haven't found it yet. No handle to close the trunk with either, nor is a cargo net standard. I haven't used the rear seat but it looks a decent size.

I was surprised at the amount of engine noise when I first drove it. I guess next to the Caddy that isn't a fair comparison and I don't know how it compares to other cars in its class in that regard. I didn't notice much road noise around town but did when I got it on the highway. It has the start-stop tech for the engine and it is fairly unobtrusive - I don't know how they get the engine to start without any noticeable cranking, but it does. The one thing I found a bit odd is that when you are pointing nose-down a hill and the engine stops, there is a bit of a lag in rolling forward once you take your foot off the brake. It just seems weird. Also one time it had stopped and after a bit started again without me taking my foot off the brake. Ghost in the machine stuff happening.

I guess it has the 1.5 turbo and it seems adequate. Certainly around town it is nowhere near as zippy as my car but that should be expected. It seemed fine on the highway. All in all it is not a car I can see myself ever buying now but I suppose it suits a lot of people."

You wouldn't need a hill holder going downhill though? I dunno. I think I'd be inclined to try to turn off the auto-stop stuff if I could.

One other thing I found that I didn't like. The shift lever doesn't have a detent coming out of Park, so when I pulled the shifter back after a startup, it always went into Low. I never had that issue with other cars recently, which always seemed to have a gate to prevent that."

Mazda markets to drivers, the rest mainly market to families which is what midsize cars are all about. Legacy is also highly rated by CR and others but doesn't sell in huge numbers either.

nyccarguy,Jun-16,"Correct. I took out a 72 month loan at 2.9% APR. My monthly payments are $405.07. Since this past September (the 1 year mark), I started to put an extra $200 per month towards the principle. I paid off my wife's Pilot just a few weeks ago. I plan on doubling the Legacy payments starting this Month until it's paid off.

I drive 20K miles per year. Leasing gets expensive for me."

got a real good coupon. oil change, tire rotation, and multi point inspection. plus a wash (that it does not need and I will decline). $29.95 at the dealer. Might be a slight surcharge for blend oil though (not sure on that). But it doesn't use synthetic."

It isn't the mileage that makes it expensive per se - your vehicles depreciate faster than average because of the mileage. That applies whether you're leasing or buying - depreciation is depreciation. But if you're buying you can spread the cost out over 6 years whereas if you're leasing you have to pay the higher first 3 years of depreciation each time you get a new lease.

You'd be in the same boat if you purchased and traded it in after 3 years - you're still paying that super high depreciation."
fushigi,Jun-16,"6 years .. or longer. I have a coworker who yesterday was talking about her 2003 Nissan Z with 202K miles. It's her daily driver from Indiana into Chicago & sees 17-18K miles per year. No significant repairs beyond a manifold cover & replacement of part of the exhaust (due to rust from salted roads in the midwest). She dreads the idea of taking on a payment again.

My '10 CUV w/53K miles has been payment-free for a year and a half. I'm setting aside $300 a month anyways to build up a down payment for my next ride and to cover any non-gas expenses in the mean time. It adds up quick and keeps the idea, at least, of a payment in the budget. I'd much rather be making a payment to myself than to a finance co. Also good to earn interest instead of paying it."

That's probably without eyesight.  The eyesight is fantastic technology and is very reasonably priced for what you get.  I originally wanted an eyesight equipped car, but was told due to initial demand, I'd have to wait.  That wasn't an option as I had an expiring lease and needed a car.  That being said, it would have also cost me a lot more money.  Eyesight was only available if you got the aunroof & navigation.  Plus at the time they were not generously discounting eyesight equipped cars.  I also have been living without it for the past 21 months and have managed to survive."
stickguy,Jun-16,"Bradd, you are IMO a good candidate for a few tear OD, low miles buy. Like GGs accord (2013 with 17k on it). After 3 years, it is 6yo with~75k on it, so relatively normal miles. Easy to sell, or ready for many more years of use.

Works even better for cars that have worse initial depreciation. Maybe a sonata, or fusion.

I used to use this plan for my car. Might go back to it next time. Or if my miles are still looking to be real low, the flip side. Save even more $ on a higher mile unit (like what your legacy will be) and put on low miles to average it out!"

I see you posted for a price check on your 2014 Audi A6 3.0. Did you sell it yet?. My friend sold same car but in black last month . He had trouble selling it. It sold for 30.5 k after 3 months.

Legacy 4cyl is loud and underpowered. MPG's may be suspect? but a great all around vehicle. Subaru's Small brand less competitive on pricing hurts them .

Mazda6 is not a family sedan in my eye and probably most buyers.

Egress / ingress is terrible. 6ft or over folks will hit there heads getting in and out of vehicle. Seats are brutally hard and uncomfortable. Cockpit to low / contoured . Tight inside for a family of 4. Its a Great handling vehicle . I call it the poor mans BMW without the upgrades and motor."

What's your take on the 2016 Camry and Malibu?

The Sonata or Optima. I liked the Sonata as far as interior room and quiet cabin. Its a straight highway cruiser that was a pleasure to drive. Handling when pushed was iffy. Optima was definitely a better handling more fun to drive with a lot of Sonata's good quality's. Sonata's cock pit was more open and bigger. Kia's SXL model and Turbo engine was fast and shifted effortless. Very quiet also . Kia did a fine job on this model."

I do have to plan my passing maneuvers ahead of time. Subaru did an excellent job of keeping the engine noise inside the cabin to a minimum (using liquid filled engine mounts). Wind noise seems to be a bit of an issue. I noticed how ""thin"" the roof was the other day when I was polishing & waxing it with my orbital.

The car is screwed together quite well. The ride is on the sporty side of compliant. Handling is tighter than normal now that I added the rear sway bar from an Outback 3mm thicker). The AWD is worth it's weight in gold..

backy,Jun-16,"There's been discussion here about the strong sales of the midsized-inside 2016 Civic. I read something in the August MT that sheds some light on why the new Civic is selling so well. According to the article, Honda is most likely selling every Civic in the USA at a loss, to grab market share. Hence it is priced very well against the competition, even against cars with fewer features. The author asks the question, how will the Civic do once Honda raises the price on it, as it will need to do at some point as they can't afford to sell 300k+ cars at a loss every month.

In other news, I thought it was interesting that Kia led the latest JD Power IQS--the first time a non-luxury brand has topped that survey. Also interesting that Hyundai was 3rd, behind Porsche. Toyota was 4th--even topping its luxury brand Lexus. Among US brands, Chevy, Buick, Lincoln, Ford, and GMC all beat the industry average. Curiously, Honda, Acura, Subaru, and Mazda were in the bottom third of the rankings. Overall, US automakers had a better collective score than foreign automakers. Chrysler and Jeep improved the most compared to the last study, but were still in the lower half. GM had the most individual awards. Another indication that car quality is continuing to improve, even as cars get more complex."

I agree with you about vehicle reliability last 15 years . Here in the Northeast especially NY area vehicles with 300k plus miles probably will need 3 to 4 full front end replacements at that mark. Chrysler and American vehicles will fear even worse. Acura's are good solid vehicles.

My old 03 Honda Pilot gave to my niece at 55k and was then passed onto her younger brother is still going. 210k miles Last I checked. Trans replaced at 100k. ($2500 ) Full Ft. end replacement twice. (2) timing belts water pump replacement. and some minor repairs.

Mr_Shiftright,Jun-16,"300K is still a remarkable achievement for any car. I'm sure the bell curve is much less.

There's the rub. It's like that research that was done on what would happen if medical science could make you ""live forever"". They calculated that even if all your diseases could be cured, and aging stopped, you'd still die at around 300 years because eventually your entire body would be blown up, crushed, eaten, or some such.

You're right that it's a trend, but some cars still have good rear visibility. The Accord still has excellent visibility all round. All BMWs, of course.

In the compact/midsize class, I think the Cruze, Corolla, and Elantra have better rear visibility than the Civic."
backy,Jul-16,"Does anyone else see what I think is a trend--that the so-called ""compacts"" are stealing sales from their mid-sized stablemates? e.g. Civic from Accord, Corolla from Camry, Elantra from Sonata? Note the sales of these compacts are close to or even exceeding the mid-sized sales from the same brands, and the mid-sized sales are way down from levels of even a year or so ago. I think many compacts have plenty of room for many singles, couples, and small families. The rear seats of the Jetta and Corolla are particularly roomy, and the Jetta for one has a huge trunk. And there's price--some of the compacts can be had for less than $16k for base models, which aren't stripped cars as they were a few years ago.

Then there's the trend towards SUVs in this time of ~$2 a gallon gas, which is also eating into mid-sized sedan sales. The fact that many of the current mid-sizers can average over 30 mpg isn't as important to some people as it once was."

I do believe the Civic is stealing potential Accord sales. You can get a loaded Civic that lists for around $27.5k, that is almost as equipped as an Accord EXL with Sensing and Nav.

ab348,Jul-16,"Yes, that is Dark Adriatic Blue and it is a gorgeous color. I agree though, it is really a 2 adults + 2 kids car (or 3 adults+1 kid if the adult in the front seat is not too tall)."
andres3,Jul-16,"The ATS has a 4-door option right? Guess how hard it is for an adult to get in and out of the TTS' back seat. I use the ""throw my body"" into the seat method for getting in, and two arms and two legs method for getting out; and that's the driver's seat. Good thing I'm not so old my back is bothering me (knock on wood)."

Yes, that's what I'm talking about. It is tight although not as bad as the TTS obviously, which I didn't even know had a rear seat."

It is tight although not as bad as the TTS obviously, which I didn't even know had a rear seat.Yes, unlike the Cayman with no rear seat, the TTS has one; it's a 2 + 2 car theoretically, not recommended for anyone over 5' tall though, and only then if the person in front isn't too much over 5' themselves. My 5'10 & 5'6 parents were a tight fit, but doable for the fun of it; definitely not for a very long trip though.Only someone without legs would fit behind my 6'3"" frame and driver's seat."

I looked at the Grand Touring, they didn't have a Signature model. Mazda did a great job on this vehicle. The salesman asked if I would like to drive it, of course I would, but declined. It would be cruel tempatation. One thing I noticed is that the cargo, and third row is a lot smaller than the Pilot's. They had a sharp Mazda 6 in the showroom with white leather. It looked really rich."
nyccarguy,Jul-16,@sda - that was my biggest attraction to the Pilot was the cargo space and the usable 3rd row. Did you ever have a problem when your Pilot goes into 3cylinder mode?

When the ECO light comes on it sometimes feels like the engine is lugging, vibrates a little and puts out a subtle rumbling sound. It doesn't bother me that much but would prefer that it didn't operate that way. Last January we had a TSB addressed that was ECO/VCM related. My wife was driving to work when the check engine light and I think the TCS light came on. She noticed that the ECO light no longer came on when she was familiar with it doing so and it was running somewhat roughly. Turns out one of the plugs had fouled. Honda did some type of computer update, replaced 4 spark plugs that are affected by the VCM. I had them replace the other 2 spark plugs ($140!, really?), so at 83k all plugs have been replaced. It has just under 90k now, and all is well."

Will probably go down to one vehicle eventually but that will have to be done with much advanced notice about appointments as the public transport is horrible down here.
Will be interesting to see what fits our size parameters the next time we're in the market but don't see that happening till at least 2020 at this juncture.

Have you looked at the current Corolla? It's gotten bigger! The rear seat is humongous--roomier than some true mid-sized sedans. Trunk isn't too shabby in size either. And the FE is great--I'm driving a rental Corolla this week and got 44 mpg on a 200 mile trek from the airport to our destination, much of that at 70+ mph. Driving another 300 miles around town during the week has dropped the mpg to 40, but still very good overall. The CVT sucks for performance, but it keeps the RPMs low when cruising. I think it could replace a true mid-sized car for many people. Problem is, besides the sluggish CVT, it seems tinny and cheaply built. It only has 25k miles on it and it has several squeaks/rattles. I know it's a rental car, but I've driven many rentals with more miles and they were still tight. That's one of the benefits of buying a base mid-sized car like the Accord LX--it's a car designed to sell for up to ~$35k in high-trim form, thus the quality must satisfy people who shell out that much money. But a compact like the Corolla is designed to sell in base form for as low as ~$15k and still make a profit, so there has to be some cost-cutting someplace."

thebean,Jul-16,Very nice!  I think the EX is the best value of the Accords.  I just don't like leather seats in the heat of Texas.
berri,Jul-16,"I think Honda has improved the looks of the Accord and it reflects in that white color. Leather seats - I remember years back hopping into a friend's big Mercury convertible, top down with ""white"" leather seats in Charleston, SC one summer afternoon. I was wearing cutoffs and yep, gave myself a nice burn welt"
benjaminh,Jul-16,"It happens that this is the 40th anniversary of the Accord. Good story and video about that below:

http://www.autoblog.com/2016/06/30/honda-accord-40-anniversay-birthday/

Glad to have a car made in the USA in Ohio. This is the 4th Accord my family has owned that was built at Marysville. The first three have been great, and I'm expecting the same from this one....So far it seems like the best one yet.

My wife has a 2013 Accord, and so I figured that this one—aside from the styling—would be close to identical. They are similar, but there are some noticeable differences.

First, the handling with my 2016 Accord seems better than on the 2013. By better I mean slightly firmer and with less body roll and no tire squeal when taking turns with just a little bit of speed. It's definitely better than my 2008 Accord, which could almost ""wallow"" a little when pushed a bit. The 2016 Accord is a little closer to being a sports sedan, I think. Here's what Honda has said about the improvements in the suspension for 2016:

""All 2016 Accords apply higher performance dampers and new compliance bushings. All models get new front and rear high performance dampers designed to offer increased response especially in the initial stage of body movement. Development work has centered on reduced internal friction and increased linearity, resulting in the redesign of the oil channel aiding both ride comfort and handling precision.....The struts are specially tuned for the ideal blend of comfort and handling. Innovative features include efficient hydraulic valves and seals, a low-friction Teflon® internal bushing, optimized oil specifications, and a special rebound damper spring that dramatically reduces body roll while turning. The Accord Sport, EX, EX-L and Touring Sedan, and the EX and EX-L Coupe all feature a front strut-tower connecting bar that further improves handling response. For 2016 models, a more ridged strut tower bar contributes to overall body stiffness and dynamic handling response.""

http://hondanews.com/releases/2016-honda-accord-press-kit-chassis

I know that's press release stuff, but to me there does feel like there's something behind it. This car is a bit more fun to drive than the other Accords I've owned."
benjaminh,Jul-16,"A second improvement over my wife's 2013 Accord is the aluminum hood. It's much lighter! Not that it's so hard to lift a regular hood, but this one feels like it weighs half as much as the ones on previous Accords.

Does any other midsize sedan have an aluminum hood?"

But as of now is the Accord the only midsize car with aluminum?"
ab348,Jul-16,"benjaminh said:

Pretty sure both the Fusion and Malibu use aluminum hoods."
Sandman6472,Jul-16,"Was in a friends new 2016 Subaru Legacy last night...very very nice vehicle. Leather seats and all the tech goodies Subaru is known for. Got silver over black which is kinda boring, much prefer the blue color they have. They're leasing again which is great for the dealer as it'll have low miles when turned in going by the 2013 CrossTracX he just turned in. Had about 29 and change on it so the selling dealer gets back a nice clean used car that they can probably CPO and get more from the second owner.

My '96 Mazda Millenia that I leased for 24 months had an aluminum hood. Little did I know Mazda did some decontenting and the '98 Millenia that I purchased had a heavier steel hood.

brian125,Jul-16,"The auto repair shops are loving these newer vehicles aluminum hoods, plastic bumpers front and back. Years ago you hit something doing 30mph you had a dent. Now its 3k worth of damage.

When I first bought my Genesis had it 3 weeks I parked in a lot at night that had a concrete stop barrier that separated the lanes. I Must of pulled to far over it and it had a metal rebar sticking up that caught the bumper when I was backing out. It ripped the bumper off half way and tore up the plastic underneath. The new Plastic under piece I ordered from Hyundai was over $300 not to mention the scratched bumper and broken bumper clips. The front of my vehicle would crumble in a frontal. Scary"
benjaminh,Jul-16,"Top reasons I like my new 2016 Accord EX....

1. AndroidAuto/AppleCarplay. Wow. The google maps navi on the dash works much better than the built-in navi on my 2008 or even on my wife's 2013. Communicating with it is a breeze: ""Find Indian restaurant,"" ""Displaying local Indian restaurants"" along with their ratings, and one touch to direct you there or call them.

2. Remote start. Cools your car off in summer, or warms it up and defrosts it in Winter while you're inside having your last cup of coffee and brushing your teeth.

3. 39 mpg on our first highway trip. Beat the EPA hwy estimate on the first tank.

4. Aluminum hood. Makes it easier to put in washer fluid, check the oil, etc.

5. LED daytime running lights, fog lights, and tail lights.

6. Next generation XM that let's you ""rewind"" and ""fast forward,"" as well as combine stations on your presets (for instance you can combine 60s on 6 and 70s on 7 to get songs from both stations mixed together).

7. Cloth seats. Honestly I like these better than leather in our hot climate. They are cooler in hot weather and warmer in cold weather. Nice quality fabric on the EX. Sill have a power driver's seat with power lumbar support.

8. HD FM radio. Better reception and no static. Works great.

9. HondaLink. Kinda like GM's ONstar, except it's free. If, god forbid, your airbags deploy, it calls the closest emergency services automatically.

10. Honda Lanewatch. Color camera on the right side of your car helps you see what's back there, including if there's a bike approaching, etc.

11. Better handling than any Accord I've previously owned, and I've owned a 2002, a 2008, and my wife has a 2013.

12. Has all sorts of other stuff, like moonroof, pushbutton start, dual zone climate control, 60/40 split fold down rear seat, sunglasses holder, built-in programmable garage door opener, multiview rear camera, etc. Plus Honda quality, reliability, and durability."

andres3,Jul-16,"brian125 said:

Lighter weight equals better handling, braking, acceleration, and fuel economy. All positives being designed for in modern cars (although overall, cars have been getting heavier and heavier for a long time until just the last couple of years). Those are attributes to be designed for, I wouldn't' want someone to design a car based on the potential of negligent driving causing damage.

Also, sometimes maintenance/repair takes a lot of work just to replace a mall part, but sometimes I think that was done in the name of better weight balance."

Well, you get the idea. Although a fully tarted up Honda is getting might expensive these days. Still, out of all the ""economical"" brands, I don't see anyone making anything that would be very compelling to avoid another Civic or Accord if I was shopping in those segments.

Not outright saying Honda is the best of the affordable brands, but they seem to be doing just fine despite the alien bug-like looks of their new cars."

Agree.My wife has a 2013 EXL navi, but I think she has the same wheels as the EX. As you say, good enough but rather plain.I'm actually warming up to my new wheels, even if they have maybe a little too much pizzazz.PS I really like the alloy wheels on the Acura TLX 2.4. To me those are about the right balance between bold and classy."
benjaminh,Jul-16,"Of the midsize rental cars I've driven, I think I like the Hyundai Sonata best. The standard features on the Sonata for 2016 are quite impressive—heated mirrors, XM radio, split folding rear seats, and AndroidAuto—which as I've found on my 2016 Accord EX is a very useful feature for Google maps/navigation, etc. But the Sonata has AndroidAuto on the base model, making it a real bargain. And more than that, although with good negotiation you can get c. $4000 off of msrp on the last of the 2016 Accords, you can get as much as $7000 of the msrp on the last of the 2016 Sonatas. My local Hyundai dealer has a 2016 Sonata SE advertised for just $15,900, which is an incredible deal for this good midsize car.

benjaminh,Jul-16,"suydam said:

I agree that a base Sonata is not as nice as an Accord LX, even if the Sonata has a few more features thrown in. But for the low, low price the Sonata is still a lot of car for the money. The Sonata has also seemed slightly higher in quality to me in some places than the base Camrys and base Altimas I've also driven as rentals.

But Honda bravely refuses to make the Accord into a rental car, which I appreciate.

I personally think that the 2016 EX I just got is the sweet spot in the Accord line-up. It's kind of Acura-like in some ways, and beyond Acura at this point in terms of having AndroidAuto, and yet it costs significantly less. It's not quite as quiet or luxurious as a TLX, but the Accord is still luxurious by my perhaps low standards, and it has a lot of practical and easy-to-use technology."
benjaminh,Jul-16,"Something that makes me happy about my new Accord is that the engine was made in Ohio, the transmission was made there too, and it was also built in Ohio. Nice to know our hard-earned dollars are going to support jobs in the USA...."

Although I must admit that it warms my heart to get flipped off by a guy in a car or truck wearing a UAW sticker..."
benjaminh,Aug-16,"Just took a necessary 145 mile highway trip and got 39 mpg with the AC on going c. 70 mph. Seems like that's not far off from a hybrid? Although maybe I'm fooling myself there....Anyway, it's about 9 mpg higher than my 2008 Accord with the manual transmission for this exact same trip. I slightly miss shifting—but not 9 mpg worth! I know that the transmission is probably more likely about half of the difference, but it's still significant. At 70 with the CVT I have c. 1900 rpm on the tach on my 2016, while it was close to 3000 rpm with the 5 speed manual in the 2008 at that speed. That's a lot of gas right there....

My total mpg, as you see, is c. 30. But that includes some short hilly treks to Kroger that get c. 15 mpg."

http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-31/nissan-chases-u-s-sales-gains-as-discounts-lift-it-beyond-honda

""Nissan Motor Co. is growing faster in the U.S. than any mass-market carmaker and edged past rival Honda Motor Co. in this year’s first half. That might not be a good thing for Nissan’s bottom line....In the first half, Nissan sold almost 800,000 vehicles in the U.S., beating Honda by about 6,000....

For Nissan, fleet sales rose 42 percent in the first five months of the year to 175,505, according to the most recent data from R.L. Polk & Co., as Honda sold fewer than 10,000 vehicles to fleets. Most of Nissan’s fleet sales went to rental agencies, which tend to buy cars at a discount and order them with fewer price-boosting options than those sold to individual consumers. Without fleet sales, Honda would have outsold Nissan in the U.S.....

Nissan has also stepped up its incentives, averaging about $3,400 a vehicle this year through June, a 6 percent increase from a year earlier, according to Autodata Corp. Honda’s average was $1,630, down 11 percent. Among mass-market automakers, only the U.S. companies spent more than Nissan.""

It was the best of times for Nissan, but it was also the most heavily incentivized and reliant on fleet sales of times?

Still, Nissan has seemingly passed Honda by a small margin. Will Honda be able to catch up in the last months of the year?"
stickguy,Aug-16,"Honda always has seemed to have the smart LT vision. Sell a few less units maybe, but get more for them (can do that with a nicer product).

You mean as opposed to making low-cost bare bones value rent-mobiles ala Altima? The last time I looked at a rental lot it seemed Nissan's had taken over the world. I look in my companies parking lot and don't see but one or two Altima's though."
Sandman6472,Aug-16,"They did a nice job on the new Ciivc but let's be honest, the last generation sucked so bad that after the 2011 model, they had to redo it. So, about time they finally got their [non-permissible content removed] together on the Civic. Owned a 2006 model and liked it a lot and would recommend this new model to ,y kid as her next ride.

She ended up buying 2 more Civic's before leaving Honda for VW."
benjaminh,Aug-16,"andres3 said:

The Civic certainly has grown. A 1992 Civic hatchback was 160 inches long.

Even the 1992 Civic sedan was only 173 inches long and 67 inches wide.

A 2016 Civic is 183 inches long and 71 inches wide.

Compare that to a 1994 Accord sedan, which was 184 inches x 70 inches.

In other words, a 2016 Civic is almost exactly the same size as a 1994 Accord.

But the 1994 Accord got a combined EPA mpg of 23, while the 2016 Civic gets 35, which is a 50+% increase in mpg."
benjaminh,Aug-16,"The midsize segment as a whole continues to shrink. It's now down almost 7% for the year, and down by more than 13% in July compared to July of 2015. This is one reason why great deals can be had across the board—there are too many midsize cars trying to chase too few buyers.

benjaminh,Aug-16,"One thing that surprises me is the the new KIA Optima has gotten great reviews, with a few even saying since its redesign this year that it's the best overall out of the midsize cars. And yet sales of the Optima declined this month by 23%."
stickguy,Aug-16,Probably because they were giving the old ones away. More people seem to buy on price (or features per $) than actually functional excellence.
m6user,Aug-16,I don't put much stock in monthly numbers. There are too many variables. YTD or quarterly paint a better picture. I thought I just read where the Impeza was doing fantastic. Doesn't look like it when looking at these numbers. But YTD may be completely different.

benjaminh,Aug-16,"In part because of weak midsize sales, as mentioned, the deals that can be had are sometimes close to incredible. My local Hyundai dealer, for instance, is advertising a 2016 Sonata SE for $15,900. As usual with Sonatas even the base model has lots of equipment, including even CarPlay/AndroidAuto. That price is less than you'd pay not just for a base Civic, but for a base Elantra. That's *a lot* of car for the money.

Or take my case where I just got more than $4000 off of msrp on a loaded 2016 Honda Accord EX, putting it at close to the price of a 2016 Civic EXL.

Someone buying a 2016 Camry today gets 0% financing for 72 months, etc.

Has anyone else seen amazing deals in their neck of the woods on a midsize car?"
iluvmysephia1,Aug-16,"Wow, $15,900 for a 2016 Hyundai Sonata of any flavor is a great deal. I tend to agree, quarterly or half-yearly numbers tell a better, bigger picture."
suydam,Aug-16,They've just gotten too big. Same reason I don't buy an Impala even if they're cheap. We are looking at either the Mazda 3 or Chevy Volt for our next vehicle.

But I can totally see how for you and many others midsize cars have gotten closer to full size and are now too big.

Although actually my 2016 Accord is slightly smaller than my 2008 Accord.

My 2016 Accord is c. 191 inches long, still c.73 inches wide, but now 57.7 inches high. It's still a big car, no doubt about it, but this 9th generation of Accord has slimmed down just a little from the bloat of the 8th generation.

But we are empty nesters now, and on the occasions when grown kids visit as long as they they can squeeze in the back seat it's all good.For some reason I just don't care for the looks of the Civic. Maybe it seems too much like the Accord on the interior and I want something new. I really liked the Accord, but I didn't love it and I'm not sure why. It did everything so effortlessly. The Mazda is a hoot to drive and has terrific maneuverability. And we like the practicality of the hatch.I would have felt that way about Chevy once. In fact my entire life. But we really like the Buick we have. I test drove the Volt and really liked it. We are doing a lot of start-stop driving in our new area which really kills standard gas powered mpg. But the Volt costs twice as much as the Mazda. So we are dithering."
benjaminh,Aug-16,"You probably know this site, but it's a handy way to compare the annual fuel costs of different vehicles:

https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbsSelect

Since the Mazda3 gets great gas mileage, the estimated annual fuel costs are only c. $950 based on 15,000 miles a year.

The Volt has electricity and fuel costs of c. $650 a year.

Given the c. $15,000 difference in price between the Mazda3 and the Volt, it would take several decades for the $300 in annual savings to even get close to paying off.

That right there in a nutshell is why electric cars don't sell very well.

Of course, in terms of the larger environmental picture, probably the Volt is the better car, although I still do wonder about the recycling of the batteries in c. 10-15 years."

What we are discovering with the Encore is that we are now getting the lower end of the EPA estimates, where we weren't before in more rural driving. I expect that would be the same with the Mazda. There are also several free charging stations around here. I know gas is cheaper now but it's still pretty high in California.

I think most people lease these vehicles figuring they keep improving year after year.
Who knows what we will do!"
fushigi,Aug-16,"You also need to compare TCO, not just fuel. Example: Hybrids, PHEVs, and electrics are going to need brakes less often due to regenerative braking significantly reducing brake wear.

Of course, if leasing it may not matter as you wouldn't own the car long enough to need some of the stretched out maintenance items. So your buying frequency may matter as well. I'd like to see a 10 year/150K mile TCO comparison as that's closer to my ownership history."
sda,Aug-16,"Just got back from a quick trip to Pittsburgh. On the drive up I saw 4 separate accidents, 2 of which caused significant delays to my progress. Also multiple road improvement projects that also impeded my travel. On the trip home, no accidents, but heavy rain for 3 hours of travel. I am happy to report that I made it home safe and sound. I did manage 37.5 mpg from the Accord for the entire trip."
benjaminh,Aug-16,"This seems to be where a lot of the former midsize sedan buyers are going:

CR-V 35,017 +13.3%

Rogue 33,298 +32.8%

Rav4 31,871 +19.3%"
nyccarguy,Aug-16,"Sales Numbers don't tell the whole story. How many cars were in inventory? How long does it take to turn the inventory over? What kind of incentives are currently available compared to this time last year?

It's like baseball. You can have a .300 hitter that was batting .335 10 days ago and a .300 hitter that was batting .260 10 days ago."
berri,Aug-16,"I think sedan sales are down because in general people prefer the higher seating position and utility in a crossover. Relatively low fuel prices are encouraging that. Gasoline may stay cheap for awhile, but eventually most markets seek homeostasis and the accumulation of all those thirstier vehicles will change the supply demand equilibrium. Maybe hybrids or diesels will increase changing the formula, but I think price differentials will have come down quite a bit for that to happen.

Now small crossovers don't have as much difference in mileage from a sedan as mid or larger crossovers, but personally, my experience has been that sometimes the smaller crossovers meet their estimated mileage, but throw in hills, winds, slippery roads and they seem to not do much better than the next step up, yet with generally less comfort, more noise, and less room. Crossovers have a higher profile and physics means the resulting increased drag will usually consume more fuel than comparable sized sedans. Their 4 bangers can get stressed in these situations."
suydam,Aug-16,My little Encore is not top heavy and is quite comfortable and maneuverable. Most crossovers aren't the old fashioned tricky SUV. They are a real alternative ad they are taking sales from sedans.
berri,Aug-16,"I think Buick upscaled that model so it is more refined. It's not that crossovers are top heavy per se, but that their elevated and taller fronts have more drag than a sedan's profile, particularly at higher speeds. I'll probably move up from our CRV to a Highlander or some such next time. It will be interesting to see what impact gas prices have on small crossovers if it goes up a buck or so down the road. They said the move from truck bodied SUV's to car based crossovers would mute the impact of gas prices years back, But they all tanked. Might be different this time. But an Encore or CRV really isn't big enough for most families once their kids get older. Maybe minivans will end up making a comeback whenever gas prices jump up?"

""TTAC Midsize Sedan Deathwatch? One Only Needs to Examine the Minivan Segment for Guidance
By Timothy Cain on August 1, 2016

....You’ve already heard that small crossovers are eating into the midsize car segment’s share of the market. Even as the overall auto market rebounded out of the recession, U.S. sales of intermediate sedans grew just 2 percent in 2013 as auto industry sales jumped 8 percent. One year later, midsize car volume grew just 1 percent as the industry jumped 6 percent. In 2015, a record year for the U.S. auto industry, midsize car volume slid 2 percent. Through the first-half of 2016, midsize car sales are down 7 percent; June was the fourth consecutive month of decline and the eighth month of decline in the last year.....

We now know that production of the Chrysler 200, a former platform-mate of the aforementioned Avenger, will cease by year’s end. The 200 claimed 7.5 percent of the midsize category just last year. (Allegedly.)

If the decline of the minivan sector — itself related to the rise of the three-row utility vehicle — is anything to go by, then the decline of the midsize car sector, tied to the rise of the two-row family crossover, will soon pick up speed and cause others to flee.

Numerous automakers are poised for departure, in part because the six top-selling midsize cars have increased their share of the midsize car market from 75 percent in the first-half of 2015 to 82 percent this year, leaving scraps for lower-tier nameplates.

The Mazda6? Sales of the Mazda we love to drive but wouldn’t want to live with are down 27 percent in 2016’s first six months. Mazda is on track to sell fewer than 40,000 Mazda6s in 2016, down from 71,447 at its peak in 2005....

The Buick Regal? Treading water between entry-level premium players and core midsize sedans, sales of the Regal are half as strong now as they were when the nameplate launched, pre-Verano, in 2011. Moreover, Buick has already shown a willingness to kill more popular passenger cars in favour of a market that’s turning toward utility vehicles.

Volkswagen Passat? Much as our own Jack Baruth thinks a hot Passat would do Volkswagen a favor, the current model has lost 40 percent of its U.S. volume since 2012. """
nyccarguy,Aug-16,Again - numbers don't tell the whole story. Of course Passat sales numbers are down. Look at how much volume they lost since they aren't selling the TDI Passat anymore.
brian125,Aug-16,"I'm in Cape may NJ for the weekend. All I see are rows and rows of Minivans, SUV's Big and small. Midsize vehicles are definitely the minority here with family's . I agree Mazda, Buick, and a few others will be out of the midsize game soon if there numbers keep declining."
benjaminh,Aug-16,"Whatever the future holds for the midsize car market, right now great deals can be found. The base models of all of these cars are now well-equipped. But as my new 2016 Accord EX shows, the mid-level models of some midsizers also offer a lot.

The 2017 LX Accord lists for $23,155
The 2017 EX Accord lists for $26,350

This difference of c. $3200 is big, but when you look at what you get for that it begins to seem like a good deal. Sometimes I play a silly time-wasting game of pricing what all the extra features of a trim level would be worth to me personally. This is obviously subjective, but here goes on what the features that the EX adds to the LX are worth to me:

AndroidAuto/CarPlay: $1000
(That might seem high, but built-in navi used to cost almost twice that.)
Moonroof: $800
Smartentry/pushbutton start: $600
17"" alloys with V-rated tires: $600
(Goodyear Assurance compared to 16"" H-rated ""offbrand"" tires for the LX)
Power driver's seat with power lumbar support: $500
Remote Engine start: $400
HondaLink & HomeLink: $400
Lanewatch: $300
Heated side mirrors w/turn signals: $300
Upgraded tricot seat fabric + ""woodgrain"" trim (plood): $300
LED daytime running lights & fog lights: $300
Suspension/body: front shock bar, center tunnel brace, rear shock stiffeners: $300
6-speaker stereo, HD FM, SXM: $200
Illuminated power window switches & lockable glovebox: $100
60/40 split folding rear seat: $100

Anyway, all those features together seem to be ""worth"" about $6000 to me, making the upgrade from LX to EX well-worth it imho.

That's especially true when at the end of the model year the EX can sometimes be had in the real world for less than the ""list price"" of the LX by following brian125's email negotiation strategy."

In the old S4 the Nappa leather upgrade was $1,250, and I really like the Nappa leather, but that still seemed high to me. Not so high that I didn't opt in though.The non Nappa leather is lesser, and used more sparingly with alcantara seating surfaces filling in many areas of the base car.I happen to like a really great cloth seat. The '06 A3 had great cloth seats available in stripper models. My objections to cloth were that it made getting a sport equipped model impossible, came with a plastic ugly steering wheel, and no shift paddles. Minor things, but things I really appreciated in the sport equipped models was the sport suspension and beautiful leather wrapped 3-spoke steering wheel. The paddles; I could live without those if I had to. Oh, another thing the sport models improved was aluminum rings lining around the air vents rather than black plastic. Well worth it in my opinion; so leather it was."

Can I fit in your TT. I'm 6'2 . What's FT legroom about 40'? I seen a few really sharp TT this past week. You must be loving yours ? Any think you don't like about this vehicle yet??"
andres3,Aug-16,"brian125 said:

Absolutely; I'm 6'3"" tall and I fit fine. No one is ever going to sit behind me unless they are legless though. The head room is fantastic in part thanks to no option for a moon-roof. This is a 3rd generation TTS that only just came out with the '16 models though. I'd imagine everything is probably within a 1/2"" with the old model though. I have the old Audi TT windshield sunshade and it fits within 1/2"" of where the cutouts would be for the yet to be designed new sunshade. The car is low and takes energy to get in and out of; not for old men with bad backs.

I love the vehicle and it is world-class in so many ways. Only problem in the first 6,000 miles has been the lane side assist blind spot monitor sensors, which had a TSB and were replaced (in what I imagine was rather labor intensive).

As all of you who know me here probably already know, I'm skeptical of any value with driver assistance features. My forward collision warning comes standard with a see-through windshield and my own eyes. I will say I like the back up cam with projected angle/trajectory lines. I think now that the side-assist blind spot monitors work, I still think the AI has a way to go to be fully trustworthy and useful. I find it too conservative and it keeps the distracting light on or blinking when I have plenty of space to move in front of someone and change lanes in front of them. I'd like to see it go off a second sooner with less buffer space.

The navigation and voice recognition could be better. Probably just better to use Apple's latest IOS and map (or Google?) system. I'm used to Garmin portable units in the past which are superior. I like how in recent years the I-phone is traffic-smart in routing you through high traffic effectively and efficiently, and changing that route in relatively real-time due to slow downs on certain roads. I was told there is a voice-learning program in the car, to make it work better, just need an Audi - Genius like @roadburner is with BMW to help me, or I need to read the manual. Can't find the oil level gauge on-screen either! But I have an Oil Temp gauge which I like.

I still think that 255/35R19 is the way to go for this car, but the 255/30R20's that came with it look great.

My long-term fuel economy is only 22.7 MPG, but I like to have a heavy foot and drive at speeds that I'm lucky I don't get ticketed for speeding more frequently (knock on wood). It's an improvement over what I got in the S4 with my driving style, so I'm enjoying it.

The new TTS' specialty is definitely the balanced handling with high levels of grip/traction and the ultimate Audi-fied quattro-ified Haldex rear-biased (in dynamic mode) AWD system.. With a Stage 1 tune it'll be a straight-line beast too. It is very quick, but not quite push you back into your seat hard & fast stock. Keep in mind I'm coming off a stage 1 tuned S4 too.

Lastly, push-button start and the TFT/HD monitor gauge screen are things you miss once you get used to them."

benjaminh,Aug-16,"Here's an interesting little fact....

It takes more gas money to drive a little 2-door mini Cooper 15,000 miles than it takes to drive a 4-door Accord or Altima 15k miles.

For 2016 the 2-door Mini with the 1.5 turbo is rated 31 mpg combined. The Accord and Altima are also rated 31 mpg combined.

But the Mini requires premium gas, and so has total fill-up costs of c. $1300 a year.

That's $250 more a year than the fill up costs for the Accord or Altima, which of course take regular gas, and can be gassed for a year for c. $1050.

It's puzzling to me that these cars are all rated 31. Why does such a small car, recently redesigned with an advanced BMW engine, not get higher mpg than a midsize car?"
Michaell,Aug-16,"Because the mini is not engineered for economy, but for fun."
Sandman6472,Aug-16,"I drove 3 new Optima's yesterday, a couple white over black and one white over beige, and I think they really are the best midsize vehicle out there, besides the Sonata which drives about the same. Seating is very comfortable for 5, dash layout is almost perfect with great ergonomics, decent stereo system, great get up and go and never feels sluggish. I'd buy one tomorrow if we needed such a big vehicle to be honest as I think it's that good. Hertz has a lot of them in their fleet and many go to auction at around the 10K figure. They do maintain these vehicles because I am one of the folks that drives them to the maintenance area so if buying one from a used car lot, folks should feel secure in that they were taken care of properly by Hertz.
I think if we weren't in our German phase right now that we'd both be driving Kia/Hyundai products. We both like the Forte and Rio and the wife was about to purchase a Forte last time until I told her to check out the A3 just to see how it drove...little did I know that a couple of weeks later, she'd purchase the A3! She wanted a small vehicle and the local Audi dealer is right at the side of our housing development so it's close. Never ever did I think that she'd decide to purchase one as the price was more than we've ever spent on any vehicle and my limit is really $25K, my comfort zone.

Overall, MINI sales are down about 15% this year. Total market share for mini is 0.3%. My guess is that when BMW purchased MINI a generation ago they were hoping for a larger market share after 20 years of ownership.

Comparably equipped, the Clubman costs about $4000 more than an Accord."
benjaminh,Aug-16,"Alex on Autos gets up to 45 mpg on the highway on a KIA Optima Eco, although I think that's without AC. The Eco Optima has a 1.6 turbo and a 7-speed dual clutch transmission. Nice car! Amazing mpg that's beyond even the 39 mpg I've sometimes been getting on my new Accord on the highway, although that's with the AC on.

Not surprisingly, he added that the Accord's CVT was smoother than the dual clutch transmission, which is more sporty. Rear visibility on the Optima remains mediocre, as it is for most midsize cars except for the Accord and the Camry."

That is completely illegal. Dealers would sue (and win) in a heartbeat.

I once asked the VP of marketing for Lincoln why they didn't just require that every Lincoln dealer stock a manual Lincoln LS model for test drives and his answer was ""because I didn't want to go to jail"".

Ford tried to give their better dealers (in terms of customer service scores, etc.) an extra 0.25% holdback. They weren't taking any money away from the other dealers. The dealers sued and won.

It's a crappy system put in place by local dealers lobbying their lawmakers. It does protect the dealers from a mfr behaving badly but it goes too far and doesn't allow the mfrs to do anything about lousy dealers."
[Deleted User],Aug-16,"Dude, I lost so many photos when my Server died and my backup drive was unplugged by my 14 year old to charger her phone. I was furious. What I can tell you about how my Optima has held up for 4.4 years and is now paid off on a 5 year loan?

1) I drive the piss out of it. I have a HUD app called AAspeedometer. WARNING the free version has irritating commercials covering up important data. I can tell how fast I am going w/o looking down the long tube and removing my left hand (I am left handed) off the wheel. in other words, I hold the steering wheel in such a way that it blocks the speedometer. It should be on the left, but eve then it would be blocked by my big dumb arm. The HUD is mounted magnetically to my s5 via GPS and I can still use directions, phone, stereo, Pandora, etc. right on top of the I/P huge LED numbers. If I exceed 69,ph, I programmed it to change from red that matches my car (and its stock I/P lights) to green and then if I (stupidly) go to 80 mph it blinks orange. I have not had a ticket since.

2) My paint is flawless, but that little front panel with a rubber seal for the hood has two spots right in the middle about an inch long where its clear coat is coming off. KIA-Paint does not bond well long term outside on plastic...Neither does chrome. Since we are talking about that area, I have to drop my bumper to install a drivers side headlight module so I am installing HID headlights and Fogs. They are on their way from Korea.

3) Mount the rear CARBON LOOK ""k"" badge to the front. remove the damaged small K badge, fill the depression with the same 3m mega-tape that the badges use, and then apply the rear K badge. It holds up better when it is not down in a hole with rain and the other elements. Add real or quality strong fake carbon fiber license plate holder to match.. Trust me...it looks great and doesn't peel.
4) The car drives perfect. Just like brand new. It only has 52k. I have 2 coats of mothers gold on it right now, Rain X, Armor all no wipe foam on the tires, Perfect zero problem tinted windows from 2012 that I had professionally installed by SKYLINE WINDOW TINTING in Newington, VA.
He has done 3 of my cars. Always while you wait...with no appointment!!! He has several different grades. Buy the middle one. My car has 35% all the way around. I also applied gloss black ""B"" pillars so it looks like the SX-L and they blend in with the glossy tint.

5) Add Factory mud guards

6) Drop in K&N filter has been removed and cleaned twice. I think I am going to toss it and buy a new one. It was just filthy. I always keep the stock one with less than 3k and I put that in while the K&N dries. I still think K and N is going in the trash. It looks like sh** and is not going to last 100k.

7) Kicker stereo with a two 10""s box that fit perfect between the rear struts in the trunk. power is 400 watts RMS. I want clean bass for Iron Maiden and Pantera....not so much 50 cent. Also have kicker Speakers in all 4 doors, stock dash speakers (who cares when I have $400 worth of three ways in the doors) then another 300 watt RMS amp under the passenger seat. Factory stereo means no sense breaking in to the car and I do not stupidly apply ""Kicker"" speaker and amp stickers to the windows. It's like ""steal me"".

8) Upgraded the brakes. Stock ones were scary bad. Go test drive a 4 cyl Mustang then go back to your Optima. Really. It will change how you think about your brakes. Since I have no payment but still need a real back seat I spent $500 on an upgraded brake system. I am really happy with them. They came with red painted pads, b raided lines, upgraded pump, hugely better rear brakes. Still no mustang. I wanted cross drilled and al the holes in the rotors-but was advised that those edges work great but will eat my pads in 10k miles. I had to stick with just vented added to the rears.

9) Car looks stock...but like a stock SX-L. No bling...just the tint...and all the $$$$ expensive stuff is hidden. It is a great car I still have 50k and 5.5 years of bumper to bumper factory warranty that I added. None of my changes have voided the warranty. So, it;s a keeper.

Lastly, this is a family car. It is never going to be a 5-point-0 unless you spend $10,000 dollars and even then the frame is not stiff enough. So adding a blower or a turbo is a waste of time and money you can use to upgrade your home A/C to Carrier (Payne is cheap-o) after my whole Payne system died. So glad the car was paid for and I saved a credit card for emergencies.

So, 2012 held together very, very well with only one big-ish problem. I received notice of a recall on the factory high pressure fuel pump I immediately made an appointment but the soonest they had was two weeks later.. The day before the appointment it failed, However, it has a low pressure pump that worked just fine, so I was able to (slowly) drive it in. That back up pump is just good engineering for fuel economy and saved me a tow. Yes...I love my 2012 Optima EX. Oh, I have Sirius that I never use .I use my USB port and a thumb drive on random with about 900 songs. I still have a few CD's with a backup mp3 collection in case I need the USB port to charge my phone. Great,"

ctl,Aug-16,"Was looking to replace wife's commute car. Her daily commute is 50 mile mostly highway, comfort/quietness is her first priority. We tend to keep cars for 10+ years, so only considered Accord/Camry (actually Lexus ES too, value is important but budget not an issue). After test-driving both, must say for the similarly equipped/priced, this generation of Accord is better in many ways, looks inside-out, how it drives, power and overall feel. Even the quietness level is not far off. And we already came in biased since her current car is 2003 Camry.

At the end of the day though, we paid 4K+ more and walked away with a similarly equipped Camry hybrid. Much quieter than both, instance V6-like power, great MPG and something that doesn't feel so out-dated after 10 years in the age of electric cars. Accord hybrid is nice too, but no discount for 2017 so 6k+ more. (BTW, cheapest Lexus ES hybrid is 18K MSRP more than cheapest TCH with the same hybrid system...) Just to share the experience."
thebean,Aug-16,"I'm an Accord fan, but you can't go wrong with a Camry.  I test drove both when I bought my '15 Accord, and I would been happy with either.

I'm sure it will give you many years of great service."

[Deleted User],Aug-16,"Hey, I wanted to show you guys why Hyundai/Kia were confident in not losing their tails in warranty claims. 4.4 years and 51k went by pretty fast, but imagine having 5 more years and 49k additional warranty....and knowing that ""powertrain warranties"" cover almost nothing,

So, I extended the powertrain portion of my warranty to bumper to bumper....just like it is covered now. (to those that are new I own (really own since I paid it off in July); a 2012 Kia Optima EX 2.4. To continue covering the car bumper to bumper until 10yr/100k cost me $899. I had one repair that would not have been covered (they did send me a TSB notice and I took it in and they said you can't tell by looking at it....and proceeded to tell me there are two fuel pumps in the 2.4. A high power pump for any power request over 1/4 throttle, and a low power pump for cruising...thus the EPA figures. Sure enough, two weeks later my high power fuel pump quit and I was able to limp it over to the dealer for repair. I didn't even need a tow.....and I had an appointment THAT DAY to get it replaced. Cray cray.

Now, for those who are not extended warranty buyers, that pump was $1,800. the labor was 1.5 hours. So, $2,200. So, almost anything that throws a code is gonna cost you $500 bucks, and the older the car gets the more failures are to be expected in an urban, hot, brutal area. Stop and go. Lots of engine idling. So here is my car pics now. If any one of you care to go back and look at my cars baby pics...they look EXACTLY the same.
Kia Optima=Good buy. IMO!!!!!!"

cski typically long response:

If you didn't need a tow, and it was covered under the regular factory 5/60 warranty I would think you would be pleased Do you understand how Gas Direct Injection(GDI) works? I spent zero and they changed the hi-pressure fuel pump, changed the oil and washed it....including power washing the rims and tires to get the grime off and a nice tire foam (same brand as I use). I was thrilled. It sounds like you don't like Korean cars. If I had a 3/36 warranty and it died at 46k that would be 10 YEARS over the factory warranty. No, they would NOT cover it under the terms I signed. Honda tricks people into thinking their cars are better.....and they are in some ways. The Korean cars are the same. Strong in some areas and weaker than others. You want to know why Honda ONLY HAS A 3/36????? It is not because it doesn't need a longer one, it's because they don't want to PAY FOR A LONGER ONE. That's how they got sued over all those tranny problems in 2007/08 people felt they deserved a transmission that would last longer than 40 to 75k...and I agree with them,
Kudos to Hyundai Kia and Chevy too for having the GUTS to stand behind their products long term. I can tell you that with all those horsepower and torque forces under my upcoming car, I am DAMN SURE buying a Fo** 5.0 extended warranty, for as long as they make one."

There is a tip that holds it shut made of plastic...and it decided to break off...But I backed into a pole in a parking deck, and the next fill up it broke. No other damage; but they replaced it and said they replace about 2 a month. I wonder if they are metal now, Wouldn't that make more sense? Crap Chinese part. You would not believe how much Chinese parts are in most Asian cars. It just depends on what parts and how many. There are a few exceptions....very few. Kia and Hyundai build 100% of their 2.4 and 2.0 Turbo engines by scratch...then ship to America to trust us fat, lazy Americans to bolt in. LOL."

Low 6 seconds is where I'd suspect a 252 HP car to be, so that makes more sense. Might be hard for a FWD car to beat 6.2 as you may get a lot of tire spin without AWD. I suppose you only need 1 in 10 good times to claim that good time though.
No, it has to make 2 runs, 1 in each direction to account for wind, and they take the average of those two. (CD at least) They also do all kinds of stuff we would NEVER do to get those figures in a car we own. That bothers me. I wanna know how fast my car is off the line w/o disabling traction control and revving it to 6,000 RPM and dumping it in drive. That is not how anyone that OWNS a nice car determines it's zero to 60. I just want to see real numbers. My car is a PIG off the line but as soon as it hits 30 it is gone. The faster I drive, the more planted it feels. I suspect the real spoiler and front air dam helped out. The air dam is cheap and effective, but was torn off recently in a parking snafu. just gotta get under there and put it back on but who wants to do that when it is 100 degrees and 90% humidity. Yuk. It was nice of them to give me 4 extra clips which is one 1 more than I need.

Anyway.....The spoilers do add downforce and there was a NOTICEABLE difference in handling."
[Deleted User],Aug-16,"Is there anyone else on the site that bought their midsize, then posted here their experiences the entire time they owned an entirely new car due to a gutsy move by the manufacturer: making it slinky, cheap to operate, and still seats 4 in complete comfort? (and 5 in relative but argumentative comfort with my three girls in back and 2 adults in front. No one wants to ride on the ""Hump"" However, this rarely happens. What always happens is a fight for the front seat, and whoever sits up front is in charge of the rides musical score. Oh, all girls aged 11 to 16 HATE Slayer, IRON MAIDEN, Dream Theater, and of all bands: Def Leppard. Go figure.

Then paid it off like me?

Any similar low operating costs? I am just curious..

The most expensive service ticket ever was $400 for 4 new factory tires so it would pass inspection. I found that to be reasonable and didn't want a rejection sticker on my vehicle while I priced out tires. No. $100 each installed and no fees or crap like 'valve stems"" and ""tire disposal"".

Anyone else still have no plans of selling theirs?

Is it because of kids... and the fact that the only way to fit them in the back of a Mustang is to make their legs ""optional"" which makes my jail time ""mandatory"". Nullifying the need for the Mustang. Ever.

Anyone ever had their Optima or Sonata ""explode"" so many times that it was a lemon?

How many were pleasantly surprised with fit and finish, performance, and price for a car with leather (EX)?

Please I really would like to know how other folks have felt about their Sonoptimas."
stickguy,Aug-16,"well, my Sonota is leased, so won't be paying that off to own! I did have my Accord for 8 years, and cheap to own. Should have kept that. Too bad the princess really wasn't getting the hang of the manual trans.

as to 0-60, look at consumers reports. They drive normally. sit at idle, then floor it. I also like C&D doing ""street start"" (5-60). Both are not abusive to the cars, and representative of what you can do in real life driving."
mcdawgg,Aug-16,"stickguy said:

""Wasn't getting the hang of the manual trans""?? Huh? Back not too many years, there wasn't much choice - you either got the hang of it, or you did not drive, as automatics were not the ""standard"" like they are now. Seems like people just don't want to drive manual now, rather than can't."
[Deleted User],Aug-16,"Scouts honor: I swear to god in any of these sporty or full on sports cars C/D burns 1/8 worth of the lifetime of a clutch on each 2 way run. They also use launch control if equipped...so, no, I disagree. Maybe on day to day cars, but not on a Hellcat or a Camaro SS VS Mustang GT Coyote.

Come on man.....they are not just sitting there rolling off casually like my aunt Karen in her 2014 Buick Giaentclave (nothing mini about it).on her way to Walmart.....and, she doesn't know how to use the phone hands free through the very cool Infotainment system. I did it for her. Couldn't stand to see her die because I didn't help her get that going. When I showed her how to use Voice Text...she kissed me all over my face like a horse. Her kids thanked me, laughing their asses off. Now she calls me at least bi-weekly crying because she ""broke it""

Turn on Bluetooth on Samsung Galaxy ""any""....select ""Karen's Buick"" Begin driving""."

Best 900 dollars you will ever spend. Is the warranty transferable?

I thought you said the finish looks new Clay it down and get 3 or 4 coats of the P21's wax on it

Oh, (chuckling) I do a full Mothers gold on it every major season change We have Summer, post summer where it is 72 to 82 degrees but no humidity and a nice breeze.That is the time for a clay job and a full on wax...not a quick wax...which is half water. BTW, the car had not been washed or even quick waxed in the pics. It was 6PM and ready to thunderstorm. Al pics were shot with crapo cell phone camera. Then all of a sudden December 22nd it is Winter, Plenty of time for layer after layer of beautifying and protecting good quality wax before then.
This time of the year in Virginia we get stuck under a Bermuda High, I frequent(Samsung Galaxy J5-2016) and actually use Turtle Wax- Quick-Wax, which really shines it up and makes it slippery again. I always do it at dusk or even at night because it is 97 to 102+ here in the day time. When you wake up at 5:30 AM and it is 82 degrees already....I am NOT wiping myself out on a full wax, Waxing in direct sunlight can cause the wax to set before you get to it. Most of us dudes found that out 30 years ago. having to compound a fender and then re-wax it and hope to god the clear coat stayed on our 87 Camaro with a head snapping 215 HP 302. Friggin government and lazy [non-permissible content removed] GM. I was lucky...the 87 had Multiport F/I. The 86 had TBI -(Toilet Bowl injection)

I don't know if the warranty is transferrable but I have 3 daughters that are gonna need a car, or at least borrow a car on a regular basis. I keep the title in my name and insure them under my name so the Kia extended service plan will stay in my name. I have actually got my eyes on the new Mustang, because I am 45 and I don't wanna wait till 65, and my license will have zero points on December 1st. On December 27th, as is the tradition in my family, I am going to buy a leftover 2016 Mustang GT premium with the track package. I decided that if I am to have a Mustang, I want as many performance and comfort items I can get, and usually the leftovers are all the high end cars they have trouble moving. I will start the hunt in the fall, My car will continue to be parked here and cared for, My first daughter to graduate on the A Honor roll gets the use of the car on a more permanent basis.The other two will get cars from my mother in law from the dealership she has worked for 35 years and does payroll for the entire franchise. I like to have a plan. Now, if my mother in law finds all three of them wholesale cars, I will sell my car and buy the Mustang with a lot of cash down, or I can always get a check from my home equity line of credit. A lot to think about....but I am HARD on my cars driving-wise, and I can tell you 100% that the Optima is built NOT TO FAIL. It is not as refined as a Honda,,,,but they use them as police cars in Korea.and not the Turbos. Regular 2.4 models do 90% of the duty. Only highway patrol Optimas are Turbos. (DC area is full of South Koreans I have a couple of Korean friends).

252 HP and 7.2 0-60 seems like an under performer.

Does it weigh 5 tons? Does it get 30 MPG?

I'm in the camp that doesn't quite get Macan S's or SQ5's. If you want a fast car, why get a big heavy SUV that is top heavy and can't turn very quickly. I suppose if you are forced to own one car, and only one car, and you have a family to haul around......

I'd rather go the 2-car method from now on; one for fun, and one for daily duties and hauling. I have the fun car, now I need to find something cheap but nice.
AWESOME!!!! Exactly!!!! But then you still have to live FOREVER with ""oh we could have gone to Aruba this year but my husband had to ""blow"" his Mustang engine (she has no idea what this means). ""Isn't blowing an engine bad honey""? The correct answer

Here's my wife's X3 after 12 years and 188,000 miles- it can be done:


It looks great...except that the X3 was the worst rated BMW ever. I am sure I would be pleased to drive it with a 6 cylinder, but a bad BMW is still a great car in comparison with most!!!!! Seriously though, car magazines hated it unanimously. It was their first crossover and I think it got slammed just for not being as much the ""Ultimate Driving Machine"". Well, the 320 never has been either, but I still remember how it felt to drive mine, and it was a 79 that the owner would give me (free) if I could dig it out of the monster snow pile the county dumped on it in 24 hours. After about 4 hours....people got the word that I would be getting the ""eyesore"" for free if I could dig it out. his was 20 years ago...blizzard of 96. Well I got it out, he sold it to me for $1.00 on the title, which I never gave him. A quick jump start later, and I drove it home. My girl followed me in my Z24 (87) with digidash and very rare 5 speed manual. Other than outright speed, the beater BMW was hands down more fun to drive than any car I have ever owned. It was the rear drive and the 50/50 weight balance. Brilliant."

252 HP and 7.2 0-60 seems like an under performer.

Does it weigh 5 tons? Does it get 30 MPG?

I'm in the camp that doesn't quite get Macan S's or SQ5's. If you want a fast car, why get a big heavy SUV that is top heavy and can't turn very quickly. I suppose if you are forced to own one car, and only one car, and you have a family to haul around......

I'd rather go the 2-car method from now on; one for fun, and one for daily duties and hauling. I have the fun car, now I need to find something cheap but nice.
AWESOME!!!! Exactly!!!! But then you still have to live FOREVER with ""oh we could have gone to Aruba this year but my husband had to ""blow"" his Mustang engine (she has no idea what this means). ""Isn't blowing an engine bad honey""? The correct answer

7.2 isn't so bad. It's maybe one second off the mark of some expensive German cars.
Yeah but that one second kills the fun off the line. My car does 60 in 7.4 to 7.9 depending on who you believe. I believe both. It hates hot weather just like its owner. A/C is ultra cold though and rear occupants have own vents, center pull down console with cupholders, and I ran a charge line under the seats and the floormats for phone/7"" Samsung Galaxy Pad3 recharging.

Here's my wife's X3 after 12 years and 188,000 miles- it can be done:


It looks great...except that the X3 was the worst rated BMW ever. I am sure I would be pleased to drive it with a 6 cylinder, but a bad BMW is still a great car in comparison with most!!!!! Seriously though, car magazines hated it unanimously. It was their first crossover and I think it got slammed just for not being as much the ""Ultimate Driving Machine"". Well, the 320 never has been either, but I still remember how it felt to drive mine, and it was a 79 that the owner would give me (free) if I could dig it out of the monster snow pile the county dumped on it in 24 hours. After about 4 hours....people got the word that I would be getting the ""eyesore"" for free if I could dig it out. his was 20 years ago...blizzard of 96. Well I got it out, he sold it to me for $1.00 on the title, which I never gave him. A quick jump start later, and I drove it home. My girl followed me in my Z24 (87) with digidash and very rare 5 speed manual. Other than outright speed, the beater BMW was hands down more fun to drive than any car I have ever own"

No, they would NOT cover it under the terms I signed. Honda tricks people into thinking their cars are better.....and they are in some ways. The Korean cars are the same. Strong in some areas and weaker than others. You want to know why Honda ONLY HAS A 3/36????? It is not because it doesn't need a longer one, it's because they don't want to PAY FOR A LONGER ONE. That's how they got sued over all those tranny problems in 2007/08 people felt they deserved a transmission that would last longer than 40 to 75k...and I agree with them,
Kudos to Hyundai Kia and Chevy too for having the GUTS to stand behind their products long term. I can tell you that with all those horsepower and torque forces under my upcoming car, I am DAMN SURE buying a Fo** 5.0 extended warranty, for as long as they make one.

For a lot of people, including me, Honda extended those transmission warranties without much fuss or resistance, if any. It was extended free of charge.

I don't mind Korean cars, I'm just wary of the long term reliability and the fact that warranty is not transferable. Kudos to the long warranty though for original owners, but there is also some truth to Honda not needing a longer warranty because the warranty is never used (V6 transmissions being one sole exception).

Most Honda buyers understand this and wouldn't pay more for a longer warranty. For example, if Honda included a longer Hyundai like warranty but gave you a $200 deduct if you opted for the 3/36 instead; I think many would opt for the 3/36 and take the free $200 rebate up front.

I withhold any kudos to Chevy for their temporary longer term warranties though, because they were given with the idea they'd never have to be fulfilled (similar to Chrysler's lifetime versions) as they were headed into bankruptcy in a fast landslide that could only be stopped with about 60 billion bailout dollars. 60 billion pays for a lot of warranty claims.

I'm in the best warranty is the one you never have to use camp. Also I think there were 4 or 5 parts that Audi stepped up voluntarily to cover 7 years or 120K miles in my '06 A3 precisely because they didn't meet their standards of durability.

Hey stickguy !

I think the changes that Kia made to the body and the interior are significant. That and the blood red color on my EX with 17"" alloys,dual exhaust, fogs, leather, Sirius, Bluetooth, and huge space in back (thus the length of our cars) for such a low price made it a no-brainer to buy...and I paid $50 extra a month to pay it off early. I found out that other than driving dynamics, Car and Driver prefered the looks of the Optima over the Sonata, stating both cars lacked the stiffness and suspension tuning of the Honda and Mazda. (neither of which were on sale when I bought my car).

So, in summery, I enjoy driving a slow car fast, using the sport shift feature frequently to stay in the most controllable gear-3rd while playing race car on the highway. These little races are always friendly and we wave and go our separate ways.

I will not miss the driving dynamics, lack of real power (like over 300HP) prodigious understeer, and the lack of pedigree. I will miss all the free stuff at the dealer. Like free oil changes for life, free car washes for life, free state inspections for life and long warranty. The ability to remove and replace the giant KIA badges for the more subtle ""K"" badges was nice too.

As I have said before , when the kids are grown I am going to get that great american muscle car that really handles, and can also be had for a similar bargain for what you get.

Just a few more years and maybe I will shuffle over with my Hurry-cane and get one."

My Golf, on the other hand, rides really nice and my spinal issues have never been a problem.

The Golf is also a vehicle that's not on every corner and I do like the looks of it. To be perfectly honest, my Golf does everything I want my daily driver to do and have no complaints except the lack of usb/aux input. A major faux pas on VW's part being that the 2015 model was a first year vehicle...they included them both in the 2016 model! My only complaint and it's a minor one.

benjaminh,Aug-16,"I've now owned my new 2016 Accord EX for a little more than a month, and so far almost everything seems an improvement over my 2008 Accord EXL navi. I do miss shifting once in a while, but less often than I thought I would. My 2008 weighed about 100 pounds more and yet had less torque, and so it felt underpowered even when shifting for myself. The 2016 has a direct-injected engine and a little less weight, and so is faster to 60 by about a second, which is significant.

The 2008 was also almost a little bit Buick-like in its suspension. It wasn't floaty or wallowy unless you really pushed it around corners—but once in a while I did, just for fun. The new Accord is more sporty and less floaty. It's not a BMW—although BMWs themselves have become softer in recent years except for the performance models—but it is fun to drive in a slightly aggressive way.

The tires are nice enough, being Goodyear Assurance V-rated, but they are designed as much for economy as for grip, and so a little bit of tire squeal can be heard going around corners with some speed. It's not like a 70s cop show, or anything, but....

benjaminh,Aug-16,"I think Ford made and sold more than half a million LTDs back in 1972. Wasn't it the best selling car in America? I'm sure production numbers are out there somewhere, but I'm not seeing them. Calling Andre1969?

Anyway, I did find these stats. Common engine for the 1972 LTD was a 400 cu inch V-8, which is over 6 liters. Weight was c. 4200 pounds, which is not that bad considering it was 216 inches long and 79 inches wide. Still, that's about 1000 pounds more than today's midsize cars, which except for hip room probably have almost the same interior room as an LTD. I think you'd probably get about 10 mpg in combined city/hwy driving in an LTD.

From the mid-1960s to early 1970s Ford used to advertise that its LTD was quieter than a Rolls Royce:"

Good point. But when it comes to the best-selling car in America for decades, from the 40s to the early 70s, it was the full-size Ford or Chevy, and now it's the large midsize Toyota Camry, with the Accord in a strong second place year after year. And the Sonata even counts as ""full size"" if you take the EPAs measurement into account.

The LTD was the nice and even luxurious car that the middle class could afford, kind of in the same way a loaded Camry, Accord, Optima, Sonata, Mazda6, Fusion, Altima, etc. is today."

m6user,Aug-16,"No, the LTD was the equivalent of Buick LaCrosse or Toyota Avalon. The LTD didn't sell in huge numbers. Probably similar to the Camry/Avalon ratio. There was probably three or four Galaxies sold for every LTD. Again, the Torino and Gran Torino were the midsize cars and comparable to today's Camcords. Then you had the compact Maverick and the subC Pinto. I'm not forgetting Mustang or Tbird but they were more specialty cars."

Yes, you're right, but....

In 1972 if you count all the full-size Fords, we are talking production and sales of about 800,000. And so that was the big middle of the market in a way that midsize sedans are today. Of course the middle of the market is also defined by RAV4s, CRVs, Escapes, etc., which are in a way the compact station wagons of today's market.

""32k miles and 1.8t rear main seal blows out!!!!

by James D. on Jul 1, 2016
Vehicle: 2016 Volkswagen Passat

I bought this car in March and do a lot of highway driving, not racing it around. Highway driving is easy: I drive conservatively and all my fluid changes have been done on time. Come to find out, I'm blowing smoke out the rear, and I blew a rear main seal on the engine and may have done some internal engine damage, too. The repair bill was nearly $3,000, but fortunately for me, it was covered under warranty. I looked up a VW tech I went to high school with who works for a large VW dealership in Dallas, and he says, and I quote, ""VW's rear main seal design on their 1.8t's have been pure garbage for some time, and VW knows about this. We've seen a few Passat rear-main blowouts already. It's the same motor with the same problem the Golfs and Jettas had. This is how we make our money. Once the 36K mile warranty expires, the cost is no longer (negotiable, as always to the dealership) by VW. So the owner gets screwed."" He went on to say, ""Most 1.8t's are designed to hit 45K miles without serious problems, but with the 2014 to 2016 Passats, we're seeing this problem all the time. What's an owner to do? Sit around and say, 'No, I'm not going to repair this.' They end up forking over the $2600 and that's that, but in the end run, we lose another customer."" He thinks VW does this by design, and to me, it's no wonder after realizing what they did with Dieselgate, with an aim to deceive. I should have gone with an Accord but was tempted by the extra inch or so of front-seat leg room the Passat offered me. BEWARE DO NOT BUY THIS CAR UNLESS YOU HAVE MONEY TO FIX IT.""

http://www.edmunds.com/volkswagen/passat/2016/sedan/review/

Even after the diesel scandal, as well as my own nightmare experience with owning a VW 20 years ago, I can't quite believe the conspiracy theory here. But it's true VWs in general aren't known for their low cost and trouble-free ownership experiences. It may not be a conspiracy, but I don't think VW is focused on quality, reliability, and durability in the same way that Toyota, Honda, Mazda, etc. have been for several decades now."

Mazda? Really? I haven't heard much good about Mazda's when it comes to reliability and durability. I've heard and seen a lot of bad.

I don't think Nissan nor Mazda ever contributed much to that image; other than being competent and mediocre at longevity (not lemons, but not like the top 2 Japanese makes)."

I can list a mid 00's Mazda 3 and an '09 Mazda 6 as less than stellar examples of durability for a friend and brother in law. Also, there are stories here on the forums about troublesome rotary engines in the RX models. There is one guy that had tracked a Mazdaspeed 3 for quite a while successfully.

Starts at $34k. Gets a good review from Car and Driver:

0-60 in 5.3 seconds

""Dropping in a 2.7-liter twin-turbo V-6 borrowed from the F-150 and the Edge Sport between the Fusion’s front fenders vaults this sedan to 325 horsepower and a husky 380 lb-ft of torque, making it the first modern mid-size family sedan to snap the 300-hp leash. That’s an excellent start—but the Fusion development team kept their heads down to deliver a well-rounded package to support the newfound horsepower. The six-speed automatic is a heavier-duty unit controlled by paddles attached to the leather-wrapped steering wheel. Behind that, there’s computer-controlled all-wheel drive consisting of the usual front-drive transaxle plus a longitudinal driveshaft and a rear differential engaged on demand by a clutch. The crowning touch is what Ford calls continuously controlled damping. Borrowed from the Lincoln camp, these computer-controlled dampers give the Fusion the legs it needs to run competitively in the sport league."""
benjaminh,Sep-16,"It seems to have been a very bad month for midsize sales. The Camry was down 12% compared to the same month last year, the Accord was down 26%, the Altima was down a whopping 39%, the Fusion was down 32%, and the Sonata was down 32% as well.

I think Nissan has the capacity to build as many as 37,000 Altimas a month at its huge factory in TN, but sales last month were running at only a little bit more than half that—in spite of high incentives. As Altima sales have fallen the production of the Rogue at the TN factory has soared.

Ford used to build the Fusion at Flat Rock, but production has ended there and now Mexico makes all of Ford's midsize cars.

The Camry is still the number one selling car in the US, but Toyota has the capacity to make up to 40k or so a month, and so selling just a little less than 33,000 is well below that.

Honda can probably make at least 400,000 Accords a year in Ohio, but right now annual sales are looking to be 50,000 short of that.

The midsize segment is shrinking.

Some of those sales are going to the newly grown compact cars, like the Civic, which is now according to the EPA a midsize car. Sales for the Civic are up 15% this year, and it has become Honda's best selling car for the first time since about 1981.

Sales of midsize SUVs have also been strong. After the the big three pickups—F-series, Silverado, and Ram—the next three bestselling vehicles in America are the CR-V, RAV4, and Rogue.

""The family car is in free fall
Segment plunges 27% in August
September 5, 2016 @ 12:01 am
Nick Bunkley

The family sedan is dying, and the usual cure-all prescription -- cash on the hood -- isn't working.

In one of the U.S. auto industry's best years ever, with sales through August 0.5 percent ahead of last year's record pace, demand for midsize cars is at a five-year low.

The segment is fading faster with each passing month. Midsize car sales fell 3.4 percent in the first quarter, 13 percent in the second quarter and 21 percent so far in the third, compared with last year....

""It doesn't matter how deep you discount the leisure suit and bell-bottoms -- nobody's going to buy them if they're not fashionable,"" said Eric Lyman, vice president of industry insights at TrueCar. ""I don't think they're ever going to go away, but there's a lot more people who don't consider them anymore.""

Last December, Bob Carter, Toyota's head of U.S. operations, predicted that the Camry, America's No. 1 car for 14 consecutive years, would be outsold by the company's own RAV4 within five years. The fizzling of the midsize car segment could make that happen much sooner.

In August, the Camry trailed the RAV4 for the first time, according to the Automotive News Data Center. The Camry fell short of the Honda CR-V and Nissan Rogue as well....""

""Meanwhile, sales of compact and smaller cars fell just 3.6 percent last month, in line with the industry's overall decline of 3.5 percent, showing that the market's shift away from sedans isn't across the board. Some high-volume small cars, including the Chevrolet Cruze and Honda Civic, posted gains in August."""

As we've mentioned here, the 2016 Civic is now almost exactly the size of an Accord from 20 years ago.

And meanwhile, by 2008 the Accord had grown to be almost as large as my 1988 Oldsmobile 98. The latest generation Accord is about 3 inches smaller that the previous one, but there's some speculation that the all-new Accord for 2018 might get larger again. After all, now that the Civic is so roomy some might wonder why they step up to an Accord.

For good or ill, that's my guess. The next Accord will move into the EPA ""full size"" category—and it will have Olds 98-like legroom and headroom. The Hyundai Sonata is, I think, already there."

Oh yeah, a Chevy Sonic is midsize too. And a Scion iM is midsize too and I believe that is based on the Mazda2. MB E550 8cyl coupe is a subcompact. All of which proves to me that using the EPA to determine a car class is stupid. Interior volume is only one criteria. Overall footprint is important as well and maybe more important to many, many people.

I go with footprint and how the car is marketed. If Honda calls it a midsize, it's a midsize to me. I can get dimensions and cargo space if I have a particular need. Mostly it's just common sense. I don't need the government to tell me what size a car is."

I have the 2.4 liter, GDI Non turbo. Back in December 2011 When I bought my 2012, I didn't fully trust Hyundai-Kia and especially didn't trust a turbo whose plumbing would get literally red hot and cold and hot
and cold.
Now, I know the entire engine in most any car gets hot and cold, but not 900F. So, no I do NOT have the turbo. If I was going to buy a Turbo I would want the 274 HP version for the pure power of it, but sure enough Kia put a lot of new engines or Turbo's (minimum) in a lot of cars with guys at the helm like me.' I can't drive........... 55'!

Oh, I FINALLY found out the ""G""in GDI was for ""Gasoline"" Direct Injection. DUHHH.

Ok, I am in the process of upgrading my headlights. After months of going back and forth and back and forth on whether to upgrade to an HID conversion ""kit"" or just high power PIAA Xenon/Halogen bright super white (4011 model I think). They are sold as singles or pairs and since I get rewards on my Amazon Visa I got a pair of bulbs sold for roughly $75 everywhere for $63 including free 2 day Prime shipping.

I narrowed it down to the Sylverstar XPS Ultra White and the PIAA. Both sold $75 everywhere within reason. I have already bought 80 watt 16 LED fog light bulbs, but I am not putting them in until I can install the whole drivers side headlight lens assembly which is damaged due to my trying to ""customize"" the headlights by covering them with a Lamin-X blue color which looked great in the fog lights but VERY boy racer in the headlights.The goo/glue that holds the covers on would not come off so I used Goof-Off. BAD IDEA.Goof Off thinks my clear plastic is ""Goof"", and therefore turned about 2 silver dollars worth into opaque mess.

So, it is cooling into the mid 80's Monday and I am going to install all this gear (I have to drop the bumper to get the last 2 bolts off the drivers side headlight assembly).

So, I can't wait to show you guys the improvements. Many of our mid sizers take the same bulbs, just with different connection construction, Please wish me luck -Chris

BTW, I think the 2015-2016 Optima has an ugly front end...it's like it is trying to keep up with Camry. NO NO NO Kia. Be better than Camry. I probably would feel better if I was considering buying one, but with only 245 HP Kia kinda killed the fun. They should never have dropped the HP that much, they should have improved on the design, and made it more robust."

Just delayed for the time being. (to save up a down payment).
Well, pretty much every midsize car has plastichrome, including the Optima.And in my 2016 Accord EX I've gotten as high as 40 mpg on the highway with the AC on going 65-70.Plus with AndroidAuto I've got google map navigation that is great, as well as the ability to quickly text my wife when needed.Finally, the Accord has great visibility out the back, while the Optima has massive rear pillars—and equally massive blind spots.I'll admit that the Optima is a nicer looking car than the Accord at this point. But the Accord still has some advantages.Of course, if someone gets the new Optima with the 1.6 turbo I think the mpg is even higher than the Accord—and so that advantage would be gone!Clearly both are good cars. But you wouldn't consider an Accord at this point, and I wouldn't consider a KIA."
andres3,Sep-16,"I think the '14 & '15 Accord's are the handsomest in a long time and '16 is a very slight step backwards. The Optima definitely has a high and big rear deck that does block views rearward (and the carpeting shag on the deck is low-grade; annoying to someone used to Audi's). Thank goodness it has a camera to compensate for the lack of rear visibility when parking.

Took a 1/2 tank trip yesterday to the mountains. Climbed 5,000+ feet and back down. Computer says I averaged exactly 32 MPG for the highway trip. There were some stoplights on my route, but for the most part traffic was smooth. I didn't race up the mountain, but I kept up with a Prius that was driving very un-Prius like up the twisty mountain. Skilled driver for sure!

Maybe it is still breaking in as I'm under 1,000 miles still. I hope to do a bit better, but I'm not disappointed until I look at the claimed EPA numbers. In my experience, Honda is one of the best at meeting or beating EPA claims on fuel economy.

Still..... compared to what I'm used to, 32 MPG is very good. Oh, for those that don't know I try to stay well above CA speed limits where possible and safe to do so."
js06gv,Sep-16,"@cski BTW, I think the 2015-2016 Optima has an ugly front end...it's like it is trying to keep up with Camry. NO NO NO Kia. Be better than Camry. I probably would feel better if I was considering buying one, but with only 245 HP Kia kinda killed the fun. They should never have dropped the HP that much, they should have improved on the design, and made it more robust.

I've got one, the new body style 2016 (the 2015 is a carbon copy of the moderately restyled 2014). The styling is subjective, but my only problem with the front end is the fact that Kia inexplicably dumped the fog lamps for the plastic lower grill looking things. I don't mind the look, but there should be fogs there. The lack of fogs is the same up the line, from LX to SXL. Other than this and maybe a couple of other things, the improvements over my 2014 SX are night and day.

Regarding the power, I too didn't like the concept of a reduction in HP, but I'm honestly hard pressed to notice any discernible difference driving them back to back."

Sounds like they just stopped blatantly over-rating them for horsepower then. Probably most of what it is, along with some mild de-tuning at the top end of the power and RPM spectrum."
stickguy,Sep-16,"Hyundai did that intentionally on the big turbo motor. re-tuned it for more flexibility I believe. So less HP at the top end, but more power/torque in the low and mid range where is is usable to most people. so on paper, it might look like a downgrade, but in the real world, it probably wasn't."
ab348,Sep-16,"IIRC cars with the ""old"" turbo engine were never able to post times that were indicative of the numbers claimed. But when they changed the engine the numbers that testers came back with were really terrible at first, barely better than the NA engine.

Best I can tell, if you are rear-ended, which happens to good drivers more often I think, you are better off having them front-facing. If you tend to crash into things from your front (bad driver aka you rear-end stuff), then having them rear facing makes sense. Of course, as my S4 accident shows, you can have a frontal accident and not be at fault too.

Why a side impact collision would be different I can't figure out; other than you probably have forward momentum so rear-facing wins."

I am very grateful that he apparently didn't cross the line. Still, his imaging software IS driving around on Mars right now on MSL Curiosity. Then China announces it is planning a rover mission, with NO LANDING IMAGING satellite...like the Mars MRO and the LRO, who both use his software. He IS on the board pf directors in CHina at a prestigious engineering school. Have we considered the embarrassment that Homeland Security, Ohio State, and the Feds are enduring?? Maybe trying to play down this blunder? This man is brilliant. I don't think he makes hand warmers. We BUY THOSE FROM CHINA on Ebay!! LOL. Thanks for the counter - view. Sorry if it is off topic but China has been doing some aggressive things lately. For example. They have 90% of an F-117 stealth fighter. The cockpit was destroyed. Just to give the doubters something to think about...we tried to ping it from orbit..no image return. That means it is a real 117, and I think it was shot down in Iraq or Afghanistan and purchased by China., and the only fairly modern stealth aircraft we have ever had shot down.I am happy it is not a F-35 or F-22. The latest news is that China lied about launching a ""weather and global warming/gassing satellite."" It was launched to 18,000 miles. That puts it right in range of all our GPS and top end IMAGING Satellites. If it was for weather and whatnot, it would be around 400 to 500 miles. The conclusions are up to you.I can't help but mention that the Soviets in 1984 went on world tour with their top end Satellites, and they were so excited they brought the real thing, not mock ups (oops) the CIA..scared at how behind the USA was in 1961, paid off the Soviet driver, used a CIA driver instead along with a tech crew, and took it completely apart and photographed it in DETAIL, We barely got it back together. The USSR did not find out about the espionage until they got home a year later and discovered screws we had been filed down, desperate to get it back together before another security check.By then, they didn't even know wht country had done it, or where. So, we have done the same thing we are accusing China of. Within 11 months, Alan Shepard was in orbit and we caught up quickly. Coincidence? Who knows. We just needed to know how to build a reliable space vehicle so we stole USSR's.Ok, still loving thee car. I took out the HID ""Style"" headlights (way too dim) and replaced with PIAA $80 4000k super BRIGHT (and still mostly white) headlights. 5 star awesome.

I also like the restyling of the Nissan lineup. (Especially the Maxima) but the new Altima body looks good too. My Mother in Law does payroll for a large regional group of dealerships, with her office in a Nissan/Mazda store. She bought a new top end Murano in a kind of white/two tone color and I really like it. I wish they would ditch the CVT and offer real 4x4...but there is really no need for a genuine transfer case and physical locking diffs in VA/DC/MD. The AWD will work just fine.

The cloth is on the dash on the low models without leather seats. When seats are leather, the areas on the dash are a soft touch plastic--nice.

I thought the cloth to which poster referred was a crossweave like the Cruze's have, and I think it's really nice. Instead the cloth is a match to the center panels and the pattern on the regular seats. Salesman said it was carbon fiber pattern...?

The interior is about the same as Optima, Sonatas, and the Honda Sport I was in at a classic car show last Sunday. Black. Dark. I like my tan with cocoa brown trim parts. Seats are light in color.

Sat in the 17 Cruze hatchback they had on the floor in white. Lots of leg room in the rear for those who want more than the Optima, Sonata, and even 17 Malibu have to give. These have lots of room. Don't know if they're midsize."

The one I had was an LT trim level which I suspect is their bread & butter model, certainly not the bottom of the line. Most Malibus will be sold with cloth seats. So here is what mine looked like:




In the interior shot you see the fabric on the door panels/armrests, and that is also it on the darker areas on both sides of the dash. It even surrounds the pushbutton start, so it is almost guaranteed to fray over time as fingernails graze it. As to whether it looks anything like carbon fiber, I leave that to you.

The other recent recall by Ford which resulted in a much higher recall over 600k units was a steering and warning light default/ Door sensor that effected the Edge and Focus. There's not one casualty with any of these recalls that I know about."
brian125,Oct-16,"I was helping my golf buddy who I play with at Myrtle Beach shop for either 16,17 Edge or 2017 Sorento . Both vehicles are very close in ride and features top model . I was pleasantly surprised how good the Ford Edge drove. Fords V-6 turbo we test drove was fast , quite and handled better than the Sorento. The Edge is a much better buy then the upscale Lincoln MKX. Its cabin / console is tight for 6 plus guys . Ride is excellent and cabin and road noise is very quite. MKX stickered @52k for model we drove.

At that price mine as well step up to a Q5 if you don't mind not having all the upgraded Tech features ( cross traffic / braking system ) in most of these newer models. Q5 gets upgrade and fresh look for 17/ 18 model"
akirby,Oct-16,"We just bought a 2016 MKX over a Titanium Edge. We've owned Lincolns in the past but in the last several years we bought a Fusion, Edge and Escape instead of a MkZ, MKX or MKC because we didn't feel the upgrades were worth the extra cost. That's changed with the MKX. The standard MKX seats are so much more comfortable and the cabin is so much quieter. The Revel audio system is fantastic. And now you get free pickup and delivery on service. Not to mention the 360 degree camera and some other feature upgrades not available on the Edge. Ours stickered at $52K but we paid $48K. I think a similarly equipped Q5 would have been mid $50Ks at least."
brian125,Oct-16,"In my limited time on our test drive in the MKX. Very quite, Rode nice, Trans shifted effortless.

They came out of the 12, Lexus RX 350

I know this is off topic in here I'm a big SUV guy. I test drive most luxury Suv's. Any thoughts on these Suv's if you test drove.....................RX350, MDX, Q5 / S5, Mb Gle, X-5"

Consider the Infiniti lineup as well. I couldn't find a comfortable seating position in the MDX but really, really liked the QX60. And for '17 they bumped the HP to 295 w/no loss in economy. It's leading my list for next new car.

Is there a premium/luxury SUV thread? I also don't want to post off-topic."
brian125,Oct-16,"A SUV thread (premium / lux ) would be a good topic and forum. Most of my friends in the 60's to 75 age group say they like being up higher with larger windows and easy ingress / egress. Old geezers love the Subaru Forrester , Encores, CRV's, Rav4, Santa fe's. for reasons stated.

I was down in Gods graveyard FL. a couple of weeks ago playing Golf with friends. I cant believe how bad some of the elderly drive. If you have a nice car/ truck and park in a supermarket lot or mall your asking for trouble.

As far as the QX60 its big and roomie great for a big family. Its a good family hauler. A loaded model runs in the low 40's. QX60 ride is clumsy, feels to big . I'm not a fan of its CVT trans. Maybe the upgrade hp will help this model. The highlander is a bit smaller but I liked it a lot. It drove excellent.

MDX seating I did not like either. Resale value on the QX60 won't be good down the road.

Can't always drive in the far right lane because one is waiting for the stalling to commence and in heavy traffic while in the other two lanes, could be hard getting over to the right shoulder. So, we just refuse to drive 'em until we know they'e been fixed. Suspect it's just a software glitch but Ford is very hush hush about this issue for some reason. Sad, very sad!

I wonder if a dealer's service department with a new car Warranty that comes with one's vehicle could keep up with this for a nominal charge or under Warranty. Say a 2017 Nissan Versa or 2018 Kia Rio under Warranty. Doubt whether either one of those cars would have a display readout that would tell you what tire pressure is what on each corner. Would be cool, though.

But just as long as it told you if you have a low tire pressure problem ""somewhere"", that will work. Yeah, they do have to be checked for fitness after a rotate. I am going to research for new car sensor's available in the coming months."

Even though it was the base model, I was impressed by the smoothness, quiet ride, seat comfort, and controls. Also the FE! In around-town driving including some urban freeways during rush hours over 2 days I averaged 37 mpg, which I think is excellent for such a big car. I can't wait to see what it can do on a trip with a lot of highway miles. My kids will like the back seat--leg room is great, enough for me to fully stretch out my legs with the driver's seat adjusted for me (I'm 5'9""). I don't recall ever being able to do that in a family sedan--usually there isn't enough foot clearance under the seat to do that. Big trunk also. I think it will make a great vacation cruiser--now I just hope I get one. Like most rental car companies, the Hertz place I'm using won't guarantee that I'll get a Sonata.

He was totally down wid it. So we cruised up to Vegas (I was doing a hospital gig then where I'd work 7 days on and 7 days off at the small hospital in Willcox, AZ, where Nicholas Cage and Dennis Hopper starred in the 1992 flick called 'Red Rock West'. Bought the DVD and still watch it from time ta time - not bad for suspense-mystery-action and drama.

Anyhow - our boy was all right with his goofy Dad's little last minute excursion ta Vegas. Off we drove. Test drove an automatic Suzuki Kizashi and made an offer on the red 6-speed stick. $2,000 short of a full deck, they told me. All-right-tee-then. Off I drove. I realized about 5 miles away that my driver's license was missing from my wallet. Turned around, went back and retrieved my AZ driver's license from the Henderson, NV, Suzuki dealer. Off ta Vegas, baby.

On the Strip we cruised along playing tunes loud, digging it nicely. Pulled eventually into the motel, turned the Lancer's engine off, and BAM! The Lancer's alarm decided not to turn off! Eventually got it shut off. Got some sleep and headed out the next morning for home in SE Arizona.

So I came within $2,000 of owning our first midsizer in April of 2010. It wasn't ta be, but I think that I would've loved driving and owning that car. I look at the Kizashi's I see on the street now with admiration. Drove like a highway star."

brian125,Nov-16,"The dealer hold back on all Fords is 3% of total msrp . A 2017 Explorer that msrp's for 45k nets each dealer a $1350 check plus there dealers doc fee charge plus, any hidden cash incentives we don't no about from there manufacturer

.Example Any dealer in NJ that sells the average Joe a 2017 explorer for 500 above invoice price has pocketed @$2250 for that vehicle . If doc fee's are higher than 400 dollars add to my number.

IF I was buying a 17 explorer today I'm trying to take back most of any dealers Holdback plus if there doc fee's are high I'm looking to take back a lot of that fee to. ."
stickguy,Nov-16,"I see you can in 2017 still get an EX manual. I would be jiggy with that. Interesting to see how different the EPA estimate is though (23/32 vs. 27/36). I really doubt you lose that much real world. Heck, my 2005 5 speed got much better than that. I can get my RDX to pull 30 highway on relatively flat roads too.

but, they are still doing what really annoyed me about the sport. you get a black interior, like it or not. and light gray or dark gray paint. Ridiculous IMO, but a nice car. probably a lot better ride than a Civic, for not all that much money. Though would take the Civic if they could just include the seats out of the Accord!

at least the Civic comes in a full range of colors. And a gray interior. MSRP 4K lower, rated for better mileage. Really need to try the seats in an EX-T though."

I would be interested how the manual is geared. My experience with Honda is there is a big difference in gearing between a manual and auto. For example, in 6th gear (I think it is a 6 sp) it may be geared to around 20 mph per 1k engine rpm. The result is it will run 3k at 60, 4k at 80. A lot of noise and loss of mpg. It does mean you don't have to down shift often when going up and down hills. With the CVT the engine runs below 2k at 60 and around 2.2k at 80. A lot quieter and good mpg as a result. I still enjoy a manual, however."

akirby,Nov-16,"brian125 said:

Not entirely true. Depreciation also depends on mileage. One time I priced two 3 yr old vehicles with the same mileage but different model years. There was only a few hundred dollars difference.

There must have been some additional dealer cash involved for them to go that low below cost unless it was one they just couldn't sell and wanted to dump it."
stickguy,Nov-16,"the Accord is geared pretty long. 3K is going to give you at least 75mph most likely. My 2005 with the 5 speed was not geared all that short either.

got ambitious, and hit google. Found a review of a 2016 Sport 6MT. Included was this: Theoretical RPM@60 mph is 1,000 RPMs with the CVT and 2,150 with the MT.

so, if I used the calculator correctly, that puts 75 MPH at about 2,687 RPM. Not high at all IMO. Pretty sure also that is lower than it was on my 2005. Yeah, could make it a bit taller and drop that down to under 2,500, but not like my old tC Scion that was geared the same as my Miata and did turn 3K at 60. At least it made sense in the Miata.

I would be shocked if I did not easily beat the EPA in a manual Accord, especially on the highway.

plus, the ATs on most cars, especially the 4 cyl sedans (including my Sonata) are geared too high, and with reluctance to downshift, often lugging a lot. And at least the stick won't have a motorboat drone like a CVT!"

I remember my '92 Miata as you mention. Funny it seemed to get the same mpg around town as it did on the highway. I agree 2700 isn't too bad at 75, but if it is 3750, another matter. Hoping the gearing is more relaxed than that. Honda is known for their great shifting manuals. I would love to drive a manual EX to experience it."

the Scion, that shocked me. It basically had a Camry engine, but was geared like a 1969 SS396 drag pack. almost exactly the same RPMs in top gear as the Miata. No surprise, MPG was sucky. Never really liked that car. Was happy to replace it after 1.5 years with the Accord."

I've had a couple of cars that were geared that way. It never seemed to hurt their longevity and it kept them in the power band, but made for a noisy highway ride and reduced mpg. I remember doing a 600 mile trip in my '87 VW Cabriolet and the noise from the engine spinning close to 4k hour after hour became very tiresome. Once I'm out on the highway in cruise mode I prefer less RPMs. Quiet please."

Very surprised that the 17 Optima has not hit showrooms yet. Still no word ?? There are many Kia forum posters waiting to buy the 17 Optima last month in Discussions..

Seen a new Altima silver with dual chrome tips off the back. Look sharp from my view of it. Had Texas plates on it.

The 2017 Altima I drove base model I found it very comfortable. Feels big inside Great vehicle to lease for a bargain. What stands out that I didn't like was road noise inside the cabin . Even the tire squeal between 20 to 30 mph bothered me. Base motor was loud when accelerating. CVT worked well

A $169 / $179 month lease with its very good gas mph makes this vehicle attractive. Camry is a better vehicle but seat comfort is awful.

Still Say............. Accord, Sonata, Malibu, Fusion are at the top with Mazda6 for a sportier handling ride.

One thing they are doing that I do not like is similar to Cadillac and M-B among other manufacturers - they are using leatherette upholstery on most of the trims, with leather optional on some and standard only on the top-line models. I guess leatherette is the new cloth.

The base model is still probably a nice car but you need to get it well into the $40K range here before you have some of the nice electronic frills. And lease residuals right now are crazy low, making it not an attractive option. I like the front end and interior styling, but the rear end and fastback profile do not thrill me."

explorerx4,Dec-16,"Got a nice compliment on my Fusion form one of my BIL's who drives a 5 series BMW. After riding in the back seat for an hour with 2 other people, he said the car rode very comfortably and smooth."
backy,Jan-17,"I returned on New Year's Eve from a 3500 mile holiday trip with my family. I rented a 2016 Sonata SE (base model) from Hertz as I got a great deal on it. I was hoping to get the Sonata because I thought it would have a good combination of interior room, trunk space, smooth ride, and fuel economy--and I was right!

The car performed admirably during our 10-day trip, hauling up to 5 adults with a trunk full of luggage and gifts over a mix of roads that were in poor to excellent shape. Speeds were generally between 65-75+ on highways, with a lot of in-town driving. We needed the AC on about half the time as temps got into the low 80s some days in Texas, then dropped to the 40s and into the 20s before we got back home. We weren't lucky on headwinds, they seemed to follow us, but we did have one jaunt from Oklahoma City to Wichita with a stiff tailwind and temps in the 50s and got 45.5 mpg on that leg. Overall we got 35.2 mpg (measured by actual gallons used) on the trip, which I was very happy with given how loaded the car was, our over-75 mph speeds on much of the trip (usually with a headwind), and the in-town driving we did.

Other likes about the car: The driving position was very comfortable, even with the base SE and up to 9 hours behind the wheel per day. The cruise control stuck to the set speed very well, even up hills. The fuel gauge, mpg meter, and miles-to-empty were very accurate. The high beams really lit up the road in rural areas, where we did a lot of driving. The Sonata had a generally quiet and smooth ride, except on roads with worn surfaces, and then there was a loud hum. It handled well for a large car, allowing me to spare a cat that was strolling down the middle of my driving lane late one night on a dark road. The car has plenty of power, the few times I needed it, and at cruise the engine purrs along at just over 2000 rpm at 75 mph. The audio system was good for a base car, and we appreciated having a CD player (many new cars don't have that any more) and XM radio (for music and football games). And my long-legged boys (both over 6') appreciated the copious leg room in the back seat.

I talked with a friend yesterday whose wife will need to get a new car soon as they're giving back her Passat TDI to VW. I recommended that they look at the Sonata, if they want a car about the same size as the Passat. The other great thing about cars like the Sonata these days is, they're a steal due to mid-sized cars not selling well in general. But for road trips like the one I took, they're good options. A minivan would have provided more comfortable seating in back, perhaps, and more sheer cargo room, but it wouldn't have delivered over 35 mpg."

imidazol97,Jan-17,"Uphill and downhill driving also lowers mileage. If I drive level highways I do much better than driving I75 through Kentucky with the large hills. Despite the downhill portions regaining the potential energy and saving fuel, the uphill portions use proportionately more fuel."
akirby,Jan-17,"That's because most people accelerate briskly to maintain speed while going uphill which uses proportionately more fuel than you save going downhill on the other side. You can do a lot better if you let your speed drop a little going uphill, but the people behind you won't like it."

You wanna see white knuckle Traffic jams come to NYC. Getting in and out of Manhattan, or trying to drive thru Brooklyn on The BQE to Staten Island at rush hour takes 2 hours. That's only 25 miles. Then rolling over missile bombed pot holes is not fun..... $16 bucks to go over the VZ bridge, $6.50 each way to go thru the Brooklyn battery tunnel. Ofcoarse there's always a accident at rush hour , one lane closed, one level on the VZ bridge closed making matters worse.

My favorite new features: 1st remote start. Since my wife gets our one-car garage, I love being able to defrost the car when I'm warm inside and sipping my coffee. It automatically warms the car up to 72 and defrosts the front and rear, and then shuts itself off after 10 minutes. 2nd AndroidAuto. Works well. Better navigation than previous built-in systems by Honda. 3rd Better handling than my 2008 Accord, with less wallow and less tire squeal when going around tight corners with a bit of pep. 4th More power and faster acceleration than my 08.

Once in a while, I miss shifting a manual, which I had on my 08, but much less than I thought I would. Mainly I'm just enjoying the higher mpg, the quieter ride, and the new features."
benjaminh,Jan-17,"Revolutionary all-new Camry due for 2018. The Camry has been the bestselling car in America for at least the past 15 years, although it's been slipping a little lately. But Toyota has clearly put a massive amount of engineering and styling effort into the next all-new Camry, which is due out late this summer.

Believe it or not, it looks like they've made the 2018 Camry fun to drive, according to Motor Trend:

http://www.motortrend.com/cars/toyota/camry/2018/2018-toyota-camry-prototype-drive-review/

""Shedding speed approaching the first real corner feels automatic. And arcing into the curve, the seat’s lateral bolsters quickly cup my ribcage. Exiting the bend, the upshifts are not only finger snaps but are the subtle, cool jazz ones where your fingers barely brush each other. The car feels vastly more sophisticated. But if there’s one thing that most symbolizes its transformation from seven tedious generations of Tofu Camry driving dynamics, it’s the brake pedal’s crispness....Through a double lane change, the previous Camry and Accord lolled with noticeable roll and weight transfer; this car deftly snakes right through it. Right, straight, left. Bam, bam, bam. The steering responds with sensible loads. Its balance and coordination are so improved it feels like an Audi sensibility might have snuck into the Toyota R & D center.""

And check out the pix. Imho it's maybe a bit overwrought in the rear with the melting taillights, but overall I think the 2018 Camry actually looks better than any other midsize sedan out there, including, gulp, my 2016 Accord.

Toyota is also promising class-leading mpg from new engines and a new 8-speed transmission.

I've looked down on the Camry for so long, even though it's built in my home state of Kentucky, that this is a bit of a shock.

Honda and the other midsize cars have a battle on their hands. Honda esp. prided itself on being the sporty and fun-to-drive midsize car, thus winning Car and Driver's 10 best for 30 years in a row, or however long it's been, but now I think Toyota is trying to take that away. They just might with this 2018 Camry!"
nyccarguy,Jan-17,"benjaminh said:

I had a remote start installed in my Legacy last spring. It's great! I use it almost every day the temperature falls under 45 degrees here. Yesterday AM it was 5 degrees when I left at 6:30."
sda,Jan-17,"I had remote start in the past and found it useful. Luckily I park in the garage so that wasn't an issue. What I found handy is when the car would be parked outside in the heat while I was doing errands and being able to get a head start on cooling the car down before I got in.

2018 Camry looks interesting and I am hopeful that the ride and handling are much improved. It will be interesting to see what Honda does with the new 2018 Accord. Could be real competition (other than how many sold) between the two. Camry keeps a V6 offering, will Honda?"
benjaminh,Jan-17,"Interesting that Toyota is promising ""class-leading mpg"" with its new Camry with the standard engine and transmission—because right now the Camry lags behind.

Here are the combined mpg rankings for 2017 for midsize sedans with the base engine and auto trans. Remember that for 2017 the EPA is trying to make the window sticker mpg match the real world a bit more closely, and so most midsize cars have lost 1-3 mpg on their window sticker compared to 2016.

Altima: 31
Accord: 30
Malibu: 30
Mazda6: 29
Sonata: 29
Camry: 27
Passat: 27
Fusion: 25

As you can see, the current Camry is almost last for mpg. The Fusion with the optional 1.5turbo is rated 27 mpg combined, but I'm trying to compare the ""base"" or standard engine. Likewise the Sonata with the 1.6 turbo is rated 31, but it costs extra to get that.

Anyway, for the 2018 Camry to go from 27 to ""class leading"" seems to mean that it's going to be rated at least 32 mpg, which is a big improvement.

But meanwhile an all-new Accord is also due for 2018, and it will also have all-new body architecture, probably Honda's new 1.5 turbo, etc. Since the current Accord is rated 30, I assume that they are planning for a c. 10% improvement for the new car, which would also put it at 32 or 33. The 2017 Civic 4-door 1.5T is rated 36 combined.

An equally important question is acceleration, torque, and power. Will the Camry's naturally-aspirated 2.5 be able to equal the 1.5 turbo expected on the new Accord? Time will tell.

I think there's at least a chance that the new 2018 Camry might dethrone the Accord from Car and Driver's Top Ten list. I hope not, but it seems possible...."
sda,Jan-17,"30 mpg is spot on for what I am experiencing. Since I no longer have my long commute where my avg was around 35 mpg, my driving is more suburban. I rarely see an overall average below 29. On longer trips I easily average 36-37, and have seen 40+ mpg multiple times. Most recently got 41.7 on a 90 mile trip."

""Want A New Chrysler 200? It’s Dead, But There’s Surely No Shortage of Supply
By Timothy Cain on January 26, 2017

....The 200’s already tarnished name, indelibly linked to its Sebring predecessor, was certainly not helped when FCA boss Sergio Marchionne threw his own employees under the bus, calling those responsible for its design “dummies.” Meanwhile, workers responsible for building the 200 in Sterling Heights were tasked with maintaining morale for nearly a year after their boss had harshly criticized the product.

Combined with an easy-to-criticize nine-speed transmission, a reputation for poor reliability, dreadful Consumer Reports verdicts, and none of the built-in loyalty that helps to spur demand for segment leaders such as the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord, FCA’s decision to kill off the automaker’s lone remaining midsize car stifled demand.

Third-quarter sales in 2016 were 44-percent lower than second-quarter volume. Fourth-quarter sales slid 35 percent from third-quarter levels.

Expect a further slowdown despite the high degree of excess supply....""

backy,Jan-17,"What does everyone think of the new Camry? Just read a story about it in MT. I'm not sure what substance the designers of the front end were on when they did their work, but IMO it ruins an otherwise sharp exterior design. Supposedly the new car handles better than the old one, and the new engines are supposed to get 20% better FE than before, which would put the Camry near or at best-in-class there. But my main question is... will anyone care? OK, that's overstated, but in a country where SUVs and compacts rule, a redesigned Camry won't have the same impact as it might have had a few years ago. However, it will probably be enough to keep Camry at the top of the mid-sized sedan sales charts, given Toyota's brand loyalty and the age of some of the other players.

By coincidence, in the same MT issue there's a review of the new CR-V, which the editors gushed over. With excellent small SUVs like that at about the same price as a mid-sized sedan, plus roomy compacts available for thousands less than mid-sizers, I predict continued huge discounts on mid-sized sedans in order to keep the factories busy.

And on that note, a few weeks ago I saw a Kia Niro (new compact hybrid crossover) at my dealer when I took my Forte5 in for an oil change. I was extremely impressed by the design, from tidy exterior to tasteful interior with tons of room, and of course the FE which is supposed to be 50 mpg average per the EPA. And starting list price around $24k. Given the choice of a mid-sized sedan or the Niro, I'd take the Niro in about a half second. Here's a recent review:

That will help it's looks I think, but not its ergonomics necessarily. As the dollar strengthens, gasoline will probably make a jump in price. Also affordability is getting to be an issue for crossovers. I guess we'll have to see how all of that unfolds over the next several years."
stickguy,Jan-17,"I saw all 3 yesterday at the car show! The Niro was a real nice, tidy package. would have to see how it drives though. I also liked the Hyundai Ioniq (same platform as the Niro I believe), Definitely going to drive that one later in the year.

The Camry, was on a turntable. Still has a love/hate Toyota front end but overall looked better to me. And the rest of the design was sharp. big improvement, and the road tests did sound positive.

The CRV was really, really nice. If I needed a new family truckster now, it would be high on the list."
benjaminh,Jan-17,"The front end is a bit odd, but otherwise the 2018 Camry looks like it's going to be quite impressive.

Honda is going to be coming out with an all-new 2018 Accord at almost the same time (c. 6-8 months from now), and so I think it will be an quite showdown between those two."

I'm surprised at the Malibu's drop from last January. Was January of last year a really good

the data has to be compared over a longer period to see the true trends.

What were the sales January 2015?
And how were the sales leveled over several months?
I don't have that kind of data. Maybe there weren't
incentives on the hoods from GM/Hyundai for
that month?"

I ask him if I could look at a CR-V EX, that one appeals to me. He said the only two they had in stock was an LX and a Touring and then just walked away. I couldn't believe he didn't ask if I wanted to look at either of those. Such arrogance I didn't expect! I did browse the Accords as well as I a midsize car fits me perfectly."

ab348,Feb-17,I've known two people who have owned VW CCs and they both hated living with them. Visibility was poor and space utilization was another major gripe. Both dumped them fairly early on. An example of style over substance.
sda,Feb-17,I have had my Accord for over 3 years (9/13) and 64k. There are a couple of features and good design elements that I continue to appreciate. Simple audio and climate controls. A good back up camera with a usable display. Lane watch is handy. In addition to its intended use I have found it handy in using it while I wait for my daughter to exit her late school activities. I park ahead of the exit where she comes out and can watch for her to exit and approach the car.
berri,Feb-17,"Mechanically, I think it is hard to beat a Honda or Toyota 4 banger for consistent reliability as well."
benjaminh,Feb-17,"Comparing the 2017 Accord with the 2017 CR-V, I can begin to see why some people are picking the CR-V.

The msrp on the base 2017 Accord LX CVT is $23,255.
The msrp on the base 2017 CR-V LX FWD is $24,045.

That's theoretically a difference of only about $800. In terms of real world prices, however, I think some people are getting c. $4000 off of msrp for a new Accord (I did when I bought my 2016 Accord), while most people these days are probably paying close to list for the all-new CR-V. And so the ""real world"" price difference might be as much as $5k.

But setting that aside for a minute, you get as Mr. Shiftright pointed out a while ago some of the advantages of the station wagons from the old days by getting a midsize SUV.

The Accord has a nice sized trunk, with 15.8 cubic feet of room.
But the CR-V, even with the back seats up, has 39.2 cubic feet of space.
And with the back seats down, the CR-V has a huge 75.8 feet of space.

It used to be that getting an SUV would cost you a lot at the gas pump, but check out these ratings....

2017 Accord LX: 30 epa mpg combined
2017 CR-V LX FWD: 28 combined

That's pretty close, and in fact it would only cost you c. $100 a year more in gas to drive a CR-V.

Concerned about global warming? Want all the latest tech?

Well, step up to the EX model of CR-V and you get the new 1.5 Honda turbo, which gives you more power, faster acceleration, and an EPA rating of 30 mpg—exactly the same as the Accord.

And here's where the pricing gets really interesting....

2017 CR-V EX with HondaSensing msrp $26,695
2017 Accord EX w/HondaSensing msrp $27,630

At the EX level for vehicles with similar equipment the Accord lists for about a thousand more. Real world, of course, the Accord is still going to cost less, but they are getting closer. Plus getting the 2017 CR-V gets you the next generation of Sensing, which the Accord doesn't get until 2018. I'm mixed on the whole sensing stuff, but one thing the new generation has is Adaptive Cruise Control with low speed follow—which is a feature that just year or so ago was found only on cars like Lexus, Caddy, etc. that cost 2-3 times as much as the CR-V."
sda,Feb-17,"To me the EX trim of both the Accord and CR-V is the sweet spot and best value. My only real nit is the EX doesn't have a leather wrapped steering wheel. I would think the cost difference will equalize and perhaps reverse somewhat when the '18 Accord comes out. However with midsize sedans falling out of favor, who knows?"
berri,Feb-17,"I've looked at the new CRV, but haven driven it. From initial appearances though, I wonder if it may make some question the extra 10 grand or so for a Pilot or Highlander. I guess time will tell."
stickguy,Feb-17,"I wouldn't be getting a pilot instead. No need for the 3rd row, and the CRV has more cargo room than my RDX (which is a bit tight sometimes). Assuming it has roof rails so I can use my racksack bag, really no reason to go bigger!"
benjaminh,Feb-17,"The 2017 CR-V has grown slightly compared to the 2016 CR-V.

benjaminh,Feb-17,"stickguy said:

The current RDX is 73.7 inches wide, and so at 73 flat the new CR-V is very slightly skinnier.

The 2017 CR-V will save about $700 a year in gas compared to an RDX."
benjaminh,Feb-17,"As you can see, as the Accord's annual sales have drifted downward the CR-Vs have climbed

Accord sales in the US

CR-V sales in the US
2014: 335,019
2015: 345,647
2016: 357,335

And in 2017 that gap will almost certainly widen, because Honda has increased its capacity to build CRVs, and might be able to make c. 400,000 of them this year, while sales of the Accord along with other midsize cars continues to drift downward.

In January 2017, for instance, Honda sold only 19,536 Accords, but sold 29,287 CRVs."
stickguy,Feb-17,"I could replace the RDX with a CRV now. From the reports, it drives nicely, and is not much slower (I can live with 0-60 of 7.5 instead of 6.1 at this point). And the higher end CRV has a lot more goodies on it, and tech that is light years ahead. Pretty sure would not give up anything other than the V6 and the Acura badge. And gain features, tech, cargo capacity, MPG, etc."

Seems reasonable. And would the insurance costs be a little lower too? What's the year of your RDX? Any idea of the trade-in value?"
stickguy,Feb-17,"2013. Might be slightly cheaper but I doubt it changes much if at all. Have not asked for trade in value. At the earliest a move would be at the end of the year when my Sonata lease is up. Once that happens, one option to consider is upgrading the family truckster (RDX) to something new for the wife, and I will just get a cheaper spare car for 2nd car/around town duty."

benjaminh,Feb-17,"ab348 said:

Like pretty much every other auto maker, Honda has sometimes had trouble over the last 10 years or so maintaining quality as vehicles get ever more complex. A few years ago, as I vaguely recall, it even may have had something to do with the early departure of Honda's last president. Anyway, at that point I think Honda tried to really make sure to triple check every bit of engineering, assembly, etc. to try to get the quality right. In getting the quality control down as much as possible, my guess is they might have had to go through a few deadlines. Just guessing here, but maybe Honda originally planned to launch the new CR-V at a more normal time for new model year, like Sept. or Oct, but then as part of QC they pushed it back to Dec.....? Just speculation. Even if so, it's possible there will still be glitches with an all-new model like this."

benjaminh,Feb-17,"Toyota's upcoming 2018 Camry seems impressive from what we know so far. Previous Camrys, of which I've driven several as rental cars, suffered from sloppy handling due to overly soft suspensions, muddled and mismatched interior designs, unimpressive engines with back-of-the pack mpg, and exterior styling that took bland to a new level. The reliability, quality, and low price of the Camry has, in spite of all this, kept the car at #1 in sales for about 15 years (although I think Honda still claims that more retail buyers actually buy the Accord, since c. 20% of Camrys end up in rental fleets.)

The new 2018 Camry, in contrast, seems to fix all of these issues, with sleek styling inside and out, all new engines and transmissions that Toyota says will have more power and get best-in-class mpg, and, most surprisingly, handling that Motor Trend described, after driving a prototype, as being better than the current Accord.

But, as we know, Honda is also coming out with an all-new Accord for 2018, and we can guess that it will also have sleeker styling, Honda's new 1.5 turbo engine, higher mpg, and more features.

The CR-V actually gives us some clues about some of the little things we can expect in the 2018 Accord, including the probable elimination of Honda's LaneWatch side camera, which is not on the new CR-V. Also, we can expect the volume knob to make a return, which Honda unwisely removed in 2016. Finally, I think the Accord's criticized two screen set-up, which I actually think works ok, will be gone in 2018.

In any case, for both the 2018 Camry and 2018 Accord, even with the billions of dollars Toyota and Honda are clearly spending on them, we aren't likely to have significant price increases, because clearly the market simply will not bear that as the midsize segment continues to shrink. In, fact, I think as it's been for many years now that midsize cars will even more than before offer arguably the most bang for the buck in the whole car market."

besides the fact that our Pilot doesn't have a power liftgate, my wife's major complaint is the fact that she can literally walk out to a parking lot and see 4 or 5 Pilots in the same row."
ab348,Feb-17,"I went and looked at Honda Canada's web site last night to get more info on the CR-V. Often, manufacturers limit choices compared to the same model in the US because of our smaller market here. For example VW only offered a black interior for years in certain cars here whereas you could get other choices in the USA.

I would want the EX-L model to get leather and a roof. The only one that is available with something other than black inside is a dark metallic blue, which is OK I guess though not my first choice. The biggest disappointment is that Honda shows a very conservative residual on a lease which makes it actually more expensive on a monthly payment basis than what I drive now. Ugh."

iluvmysephia1,Feb-17,"benjaminh -  the Nissan Versa is reliable and the lowest-cost car in America. Plus, I love how it looks. 109hp - I do love my Kia Soul and you can't go wrong with buying a new Kia. Honestly, it's between these two cars duking it out to see who's my next winner.

Funny but true story here...when we have our Akita Chow and our Pomeranian with us on road trips we always stay at Motel 6's. Last year, while living in Dodge City, KS, we decided to go visit a small city in Arkansas called Hot Springs. On the way home we stayed in Russellville AR, at...a Motel 6 . Took the Chow on a leash in the morning ...for one of her potty walks. There was a fight the night before.. came out of a nightclub across the street... apparently it was over a girl.

The window right by the Motel 6 office got smashed in in this scuffle between two rowdy guys who were no doubt drunk. Anyhoo, I looked over and what caught my eye? You got it! A 2015 Nissan Versa SV in that ""Ford Blue"" of theirs. That glimpse of the ""little Versa that could"" started me studying it's lines. I'm now hooked. 

Stateline Nissan, here in Kansas City, is now offering a gun metal grey 2017 Nissan Versa S for only $9,999. $1,000 of Nissan bonus cash helps bring that grey metallic baby's price down. Wouldn't need ta drive 388 miles to Denver ta pick her up, like that 2016 Scion iA in Pulse color (Scion-ese for black) last year. Word is out that if you buy the stick shift Versa's their powertrains are very reliable.

I am studying hard for an Allied Healthcare Board exam that I am taking in another week. I am thinking of using the idea of buying the Versa S as a reward for passing the test...as sort of a carrot ta get me ta study smarter...not harder!

Wife doesn't know it yet, but...well...I'll get back ta you guys on that. Sounds extremely reasonable ta me."

If you're looking for a new car for that price I don't think anything else comes close. Keep us updated on what you decide to do. Have you taken a test drive? In terms of price per pound of car, I think that's the lowest I've seen in a long time....And Nissan imho builds good cars. I think their engineering is usually solid."

I have watched several YouTube videos from people reviewing various Nissan Versa sedan models. Most are fairly complimentary of the small Japanese car. 109 hp and 107 lbs. of ft. torque, so not a powerful engine, of course. Really good ghastly mileage. As usual, and especially since we don't need a new car, getting Mrs. iluv on board will be a challenge similar to passing this big Exam."

nyccarguy,Feb-17,"Pilots & Highlanders are all over the place here.  They are for the ""anti-minivan crowd,"" yet are just as ubiquitous as mid-sized sedans"
benjaminh,Feb-17,"The shocking 48% decline in Sonata sales is difficult for me to understand. In most comparison tests of midsize sedans, the Sonata rates very highly. And although most competitors have increased their level of standard equipment significantly in the last 5-6 years, the Sonata still has overall the highest level of standard stuff in the base model. The quality and reliability of the Sonata is, I think, pretty much equal at this point to a Nissan or maybe even a Honda.

So why the collapse of Sonata sales? My guess is that one big factor is the styling. The last generation had rather radical or even strange styling for a midsize sedan, but it had the virtue that it looked different from other cars on the road. Starting in 2015, this generation of Sonata really looks quite bland.

Does anyone else have a guess as to why the Sonata sales have fallen faster than any other major midsize car?

But whatever the reason, there are now some amazing deals on the Sonata. One of my local Hyundai dealers has one leftover 2016 Sonata that is discounted more than $6000 from the already fairly reasonable msrp. For just $16,021 you can get this brand new white Sonata:

http://www.hyundaioflouisville.com/inventory/2016-hyundai-sonata-fwd-4d-sedan-5npe24af0gh418937

At the Honda dealer a few miles away, the lowest priced Honda Accord LX is $22,500 (1500 off msrp, although you could probably get 3k off if you tried), the lowest-priced Civic is $19,000 (1400 off msrp), and the lowest priced Fit is $16,500 (500 off msrp).

Basically for the same money as a manual transmission base Fit at the Honda dealer, you could drive off with a nicely-equipped Sonata. I'm a Honda fan, but if you really only have 16k to spend that's a tough call. I think I'd probably pick the Sonata,"
andres3,Feb-17,"benjaminh said:

Incentives maybe crazy a year ago and now non-existent? Not sure why the 48% decline, but I think you have to look at Optima and Sonata sales as one unit to get the big picture. Doesn't that change things?"
benjaminh,Feb-17,"And for just $1300 more you can get a brand-new 2017 Sonata, which now has AdroidAuto/Carplay standard. It also has heated folding side mirrors with turn signals, auto headlights, XM stereo with 6 speakers, lighted vanity mirrors, etc., etc., plus that 10 year warranty. It's a heck of a lot of car for $17,300. And that's still less than the discounted price of a base Civic without AndroidAuto or any of that other stuff."
andres3,Feb-17,the base Hyundai.Kia midsize sedan motor isn't competitive in my opinion. You have to step up to the 1.6 T-Eco drive train. That might have something to do with it.
akirby,Feb-17,Big sales swings like that are usually due to fleet sales.

The standard 2.4 liter engine on the Sonata is direct-injected and has 185 horsepower. The power is pretty much identical to what you get in the 2.4 in the Accord, or the standard 2.5s in the Camry, Altima, and Fusion.

I actually like this generation of the Sonata better than the swoopy one. I'm not crazy about the dashboard design but at those prices I could live with it. It has tons of room and from all reports drives as well as anything comparable in its class.

I expected that Hyundai would be offering huge incentives to move the metal and it looks like they are."

the engine? It actually has plenty of oomph. Especially when up at running speed. But at lower speed, the issue is that, as seems typical today, the trans wants to get into top gears ASAP and stay there as long as possible. But, it has manumatic option (not that I ever use it) so can always drop down a few gears and get back into the meat of the power band."
iluvmysephia1,Feb-17,"Michaell - I'll make sure any more of my blather about wanting ta buy a 2017 Nissan Versa 5-speed sedan carries on over at the Cars and Conversations board instead of this Midsize Sedans one. I just get myself all excited at times over certain rigs I'm researching and want ta share 'em on whichever thread I'm perusing. It's all really impulsive. Perhaps that should warn me against doing anything trade-wise.

Something about the new car for under $10,000 thing that just gets me, though. Man. One YouTuber that posted his review of a dark blue 2017 Nissan Versa S 5-speed says that he loves his, he disagrees that the 2,400-lb. car gets inordinately blown about in heavy freeway winds, and won't listen to all the dorky things written about the car on the net. He briefly considered a used Lexus sedan or a BMW sedan used, but went with this Versa S 5-speed instead and loves it.

I think Nissan has done a good job with this pup and I have a lot of respect for Nissan as a competent carriage builder. Now and back with the cube, I still love the cube of theirs, and I really adore the '68 era Datsun 411 Bluebird 4-dr. sedan and their 510 4-dr. sedan as well. They're wid it, man.

We were at the Country Club Plaza in downtown KC today, Mrs. iluv and I, and walked into a Barnes & Noble. Correct, iluv went right upstairs to the car magazines. One of the latest American car mags took a 2017 Nissan Maxima 1 (the exact name eludes me) and races it against a 2016 BMW 435i RWD. So it's a RWD vs. a FWD car. Yep, the German's numbers for speed were better, but, and it is a big but, the Nissan Maxima delivered decidedly better in the fun to drive and handling  department. Go check the read out for a lot more details if you're interested. For Japanese cars, Nissan is my favorite, Kia comes in first from Korea.

American cars? Ford. But lately, Chevy's Malibu and Cruze are lookin' pretty good ta this small car lover. Chevy's done a great job on the bodies of those two 4-dr. sedans."

With me it usually ends up being a sort of ""battle of financial reason"" with my wife. This one, though, assuming Stateline Nissan gives a fair amount on the trade-in of the Soul, would just start a new note, probably of 5 years. I'd like to work full-time another 4 1/2 years. Payments for the '17 Versa S would be around the same as they are on the Soul - maybe $15-$20 more a month, no big deal. If I can't go '0' down, though, that will halt the deal. They might, too, and I can come up with that but don't want to. My big pitch to the Mrs. will be ""It's the last new car I'll buy"", being careful ta leave out the word ""ever"" before buy.

benjaminh,Feb-17,"Regardless of what happens with the border tax, it seems likely the Trump Administration will kill some or all the Corporate Average Fuel Economy rules. These rules have brought about all sorts of improvements to the engineering of cars and trucks over the past 8 years. My 2016 Accord, for instance, gets about 20-25% better mpg than my old 2008 Accord. The 2008 Accord was rated by the EPA at 25 mpg combined city/highway, while the current Accord is rated at an even 30. The plan was to move that number to c. 36 mpg by 2025, which is an additional 20% improvement. But, as I've said, I think that's now likely dead. It's possible the rules will be frozen at the 2021 level, which would be c. 33 mpg combined for midsize cars.

The next all-new Accord, due in c. 6 months as a 2018 model, will probably be rated at c. 33 combined.

In other words, if the new rules are killed, then it's basically give up, and say we've got the mpg improvements that we can, and let the market decide mpg going forward....

What about the 54 mpg? That was never in the cards, but the car companies endlessly keep using that number to kill CAFE. 54 represents the way the epa measured mpg back in 1975 when the CAFE began. It's more or less the same as going a steady 55 mph without AC on a level road. In other words, near-impossible conditions almost never found by any driver. Translating 54 mpg CAFE to today's EPA window sticker would give you c. 36 mpg combined or so.

In other words, the car companies are about to kill 36 mpg for a midsize car 8 years from now. Oh well....I guess 33 will have to be good enough."

Automakers press Trump to review 2025 mpg targets
February 12, 2017 @ 12:44 pm
David Shepardson
Reuters

....Trump EPA nominee Scott Pruitt told a Senate panel he will review the Obama administration's decision.

In 2011, Obama announced an agreement with automakers to raise fuel efficiency standards to 54.5 miles per gallon. The target, the administration said, would save motorists $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles, but cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years.

The EPA said in July that because Americans were buying fewer cars and more crossovers, SUVs and trucks, it estimated the fleet will average 50.8 mpg to 52.6 mpg in 2025."
benjaminh,Feb-17,"https://www.edmunds.com/fuel-economy/good-and-bad-news-emerges-from-cafes-fine-print.html

A useful article that gives CAFE numbers for various vehicles up until 2025. To convert a CAFE mpg number to the actual number on the EPA window sticker multiply by .7. And so 54 x .7 = 37.8, but then there are various credits manufacturers get that make it so that actual number on the window sticker would be more like 36."
ab348,Feb-17,"I never quite understood the point of CAFE. If fuel was taxed like it is elsewhere, the market would drive automakers towards fuel efficiency."
akirby,Feb-17,Because it's easier to regulate the mfrs than it is to incentivize consumers. And theoretically the mfrs just change the way they build vehicles so there isn't a big financial impact on consumers as there would be with a tax. I think hybrids and EVs are providing more than enough competition to keep improving MPG without added regulations or taxes.

Accord Sport SE - I dig the dual exhaust, the 19"" wheels, leather seats, the heated seats, the fact that you can still get a 6-Speed manual transmission to make the most out of it's 189 horepower. The San Marino Red paint looks sweet too.

Accord EXL-V6 - It is hard to say no to a 278 hp V6 under the hood mated to a tried and true 6 Speed Automatic Transmission. Lots of creature features: Hot Seats, Sunroof, Lane Watch, Leather. I'm not particularly in love with the wheels, but they look good on a Black Accord.

Civic Sport Hatchback - Lightweight, Available 6-Speed Stick, 1.5L Turbo motor, bluetooth, 0-60 mph in the mid 6 second range & backup camera all for a $21K sticker price.

Also notable is the base model Acura TLX. Built on the Accord's platform & Priced very close to an EXL V6 Accord, but you get a 205 hp 4cyl engine mated to an 8 Speed DSG Transmission, & rear wheel steering. Leatherette instead of leather. The major difference between the TLX & The Accord would be the suspension tuning. The Accord's Front & Rear Sway Bars are 19 mm in the front & 15 mm in the rear. The Acura's Front Sway Bar measures 26 mm while the rear measures 24.7 mm. If you give any sort of a damn about handling, thicker anti-roll bars make a huge difference. The TSX weighs 60 lbs less than the Accord. You also get a 4 year/50K warranty with the Acura."

The most important feature upgrade is AndroidAuto/AppleCarPlay. This not only gives better navigation and maps than the built-in system on my 2008 (since it's always updated, accounts for traffic, etc), but is much easier to use. You just press the microphone icon and say the address or name of your location.

In general, my EX from 2016 has more features than my EXL-Navi from 08, including, in addition to AndroidAuto, LED fog lights, tail lights, and running lights, built-in garage door opener, next gen XM including rewind and FF, LaneWatch, smart entry/pushbutton start, rear seat AC vents, phone charger, etc.

In some ways the Acura TLX is an impressive package, but right now it doesn't have AndroidAuto/CarPlay. I personally wouldn't buy a new car without that. The TLX is expected to get it in a major update/restyle in a few months.

One advantage that the current Accord has over the Civic and the CR-V is that the Accord has much better rear visibility.

In terms of msrp, as we've talked about, the Accord and CR-V are pretty close for comparable models. But in real-world pricing a comparable Accord is going to cost c. 3-5,000 less."

Now the ""Hot Lanes"" in Northern VA follow the privatization model, but VDOT and other Virginia companies keep 100% of the money, where I don't mind paying a 10c to 50c toll to use the road based on congestion. Here , lanes are being built at a furious rate, and traffic at the Woodrow Wilson Bridge has decreased by almost 50%.

ab348,Mar-17,"Last summer my brother bought a Kia Rondo, a CUV not sold in the US to replace his Focus wagon. This week driving home in the rain at about 30mph he hit what the city government person he spoke to later described as a ""sinkhole"", but which most people would simply call a deep pothole. He said the impact was so hard that the wipers turned themselves on and a turn signal started flashing on its own. It took out a steel wheel, both denting it and peeling back the edge of the rim, and shattered the hubcap into bits. Amazingly the 50 aspect ratio tire still held air and was deemed undamaged. He replaced the rim, ordered the hubcap, and is waiting to see if the city will go good for the cost."

SE V6 or SE 4 cyl? If it is the 6 cyl then the lower profile tires make sense. If it is just for show on a 4 banger, then you're right that makes no sense."
stickguy,Mar-17,"4 cyl had the same. Even the V6 had no need for them. If you were worried about getting power down, they should have made them wider."

Yeah, but the LS is pretty plain Jane.

And, you gotta qualify for all the incentives.

""Left Handed Offer"", ""Violet Eyes Offer"" (only Elizabeth Taylor would qualify), etc.

That said, I did buy a '92 Accord LX using the ""one only at this price"" ad. Happened to be in the color my (first) wife wanted - navy blue. I want to say it was under $14K for what was normally a $17K sticker price."

Absolutely true. I haven't looked at the 2017 Malibus, admittedly. I did consider leasing a 2016 Malibu about a year ago - was looking at the LT trim, which was pretty sparse, compared to the Hyundai I was driving at the time (no heated seats, for one)."
stickguy,Mar-17,"I'll look at them when the time comes. Unless the lease deal if the decade is presented, doubt I would get one.

Maybe the Honda dealer will offer me an Si civic for $185/month again? That deal pained me to pass up. Just right car at wrong time."
andres3,Mar-17,"stickguy said:

My '03 Accord Coupe V6 had 205/60R16 tires! Probably would have handled better with a 215/55 or 225/50.

To put that in perspective, the '07 Civic EX came standard with 205/55R16.

My '06 Audi A3 (sport package and suspension) had what seemed like skinny 225/45R17 sidewalls back in 2006 to me (based on the Accord above having skinny truck tire).

Nowadays, I consider the 225/45R17 size the '15 Sportwagen had to be a good compromise and middle ground with enough sidewall to withstand normal road hazards."
andres3,Mar-17,"stickguy said:

Yeah, sounds like a cost cut. I know I saw an approximately '07-'08 era Camry SE with the upgraded Toyota OEM 18"" wheels having 225/45R18's way back then! NO reason it should be 215/45 anything on an SE in 2017."

Shoot! I'd be interested in one at that price. What's the residual for a lease though? It's easier for me to try a new manufacturer on a lease than a more trust-requiring buy.

Also, what kind of HP is in that version of the Malibu? I think there are people that don't want underpowered versions."

ab348,Mar-17,Malibus come with a 1.5L Turbo standard these days. 163HP/184 torque.
andres3,Mar-17,"ab348 said:

Yeah, 163 ponies ain't gonna do it for a lot of people in a mid-size sedan. That's TDI diesel-like horsepower, and people choosing that are also getting way better miles per gallon, not to mention more torque."
ab348,Mar-17,Malibu only weighs 3150lbs so it's not a porker like a Fusion. But I wouldn't expect it to be fast. The one I had as a loaner was adequate and I never noticed a lack of punch. The bigger problem was the coal mine black interior.
akirby,Mar-17,The newer turbo 4 cylinders pack a lot of torque at low rpm. My 2.0EB Fusion is faster than my V8 Lincoln LS.
explorerx4,Mar-17,"We've several vehicles with 19 and 20 inch wheels and never had a problem with bent rims or flat tires.
Once my wife hit a huge pothole with her Escape(19 inchers). Rim size would not have mattered. The tire was toast and the rim kind of folded at the lip on the back side.
They just straightened it with a mallet, put a new tire on and we never had any problem with it.
My Current Fusion has 18's and it definitely rides smoother than my prior Fusion that had 19's.
Could be suspension tuning."

Didn't buy a car like that, but was given a new Cadillac XT5 as a loaner and I thought it was trying to kill me at first. I got in and buckled up no problem. Started it and the seats began moving forward (due to memory that must have been set for someone petite) and I almost got strangled. Then I tried to figure out the electronic shifter and got it into manual mode inadvertently and couldn't get out of first gear for a while. Never did get used to that shifter. And when I went to make the first lane change, the mirrors I thought were set for me had also reset themselves to the memory settings. Not a good introduction!"
Sandman6472,Mar-17,"My Golf, and the wife's A3, has 225/45/17 rubber and the ride is pretty acceptable but, I prefer a larger sidewall like Stick. Put on run flats last month in the same size but wondering, could I have gone to a 215/50/17 or even a 205/55/17? Would've gotten the larger sidewall I prefer but not sure if it would still be the proper fitment. Know it's silly to inquire now since I've already gone and put new sneakers on the Golf, but just for my peace of mind, are my figures correct? And would these both be considered a Plus 0?? Now, I've confused myself even more!!!

The Confused Sandman"
stickguy,Mar-17,"there is a calculator you can use, but generally, if you keep the same wheel and want a taller sidewall, you are going to screw up your speedo calibration if nothing else. So if you want to keep that the same, you are going to have the same size sidewall, making it a true +zero.

my car has 215/55-17s on it. the closest fit to that (wider but lower aspect ratio) to keep the RPMs the same for me is a 235/50-17. exactly the same amount of sidewall, just a wider tread.

play with this if you want.

berri,Mar-17,"Sadly, in today's world swapping tire sizes like that bring up a few concerns. If anything even remotely related to it happens, it can be an excuse to void warranty coverage. If you are in an accident, it may open you to litigation and your insurance company may try to wiggle itself out of the situation."

I get what you are saying, and you are right. I remember clearly that my 1987 Chevy Z24 (V6.. Multi-Port-Fuel Injected engine had 152 HP/179 lb ft . It had 215/60/14 tires and was governed to 115 MPH. You could also make 225 cross section tires fit the stock rims, which my best friend had (Falcon Tire 225/60/14). I installed the same when my tires wore out. These were the good old days when you could turn your rotors.....but that was because they were not vented in the front or rear like we enjoy...which cools them quickly enough to avoid warping from over heating. This is why my Optima non vented rear disk brakes are heavily warped and the fronts less so, but they are all warped after 56,800 miles. The Cavalier Z24 was known for brake issues

I have all of my brake kit in stock (well..sitting in the corner of my dining room). They are cross drilled, slotted, and the fronts are vented. The rears are ""just"" drilled and slotted. I already have ceramic pads installed last month, so I HAVE to get these rotors on ASAP. The dealer is installing them on the 14th since they are OEM on their performance (turbo) cars like the Veloster Turbo, and Nakamoto are Japanese rotors so I am taking a shot in the dark and installing them.
Feedback from anyone with slotted and cross drilled brakes on your midsize now or in the past would be great."
explorerx4,Mar-17,How much do your new brake components weigh compared to your oem brake parts?
[Deleted User],Mar-17,"Only about 10% lighter on these particular rotors. They will definitely stop the car faster, but you don't want to tear chunks out of your pads in the process.

I am having them installed on the 25th!!!! , and he is coming here to do the job. My friend Scott hooked me up with a master mechanic that was let go because of issues between him and the new owners. I spoke to him for a half hour, and I have the word of my best friend as well that he does top notch work. $225 to install!!!! That is half what shops charge. Also, I have done brake jobs many times before, so I will be watching to make sure he has too. If I start heaaring Ummmm???? or aaaaaaahhhh??? coming out his mouth he is done for."
backy,Mar-17,"I made my annual pilgrimage to the Greater Twin Cities Auto Show yesterday. For the first time in many years, I spent almost no time looking at mid-sized sedans, because there's very little new in that realm. I went to check out the new Camry, but all they had was a sports model on a tilted, rotating platform (read: can't get inside) that was absolutely hideous, IMO. It was white with black roof and black trim and wheels. My oldest son was put off by the looks also, and I told him the lower trims might look better. He noted it looked ""angry"" in front, and in fact a lot of cars including most Toyotas seem to have that ""angry"" nose these days.

I spent most of my time looking at new small cars like the Hyundai Ioniq (my younger son's favorite car from the show, and one of my favorites also), the Kia Niro (another favorite of mine), the Toyota iA (the only Toyota I'd consider buying except the 86), the Mazda3, the Civic hatchback (I like the old style Civic hatches better), and the Impreza ($27k and no rear center armrest??), and small SUVs like the new CR-V (nicely done inside and out), Tucson, Sportage, CX-5, HR-V (love the magic seats!), and Rogue Sport (like a Rogue but with a cramped rear seat).

I won't need to get a new car for myself or my wife for at least 3 years, but if I had to get one today (e.g. car is totaled in an accident) I'd probably get an Ioniq or Niro or slightly used Mazda3 for myself and a slightly used CX-5 or HR-V for my wife (she needs the higher seating position of an SUV and doesn't like driving a brand new vehicle)."
